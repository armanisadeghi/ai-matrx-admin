    - Supports drill-down interactions, filtering, and exporting charts as images or data.

### 7. **List Component**
- **Purpose**: Display a list view of data with customizable templates (e.g., user list, product catalog).
- **Props**:
    - `tableName` (string): Name of the table to pull data from.
    - `itemTemplate` (optional): Template function or component to customize how each list item is rendered.
- **Functionality**:
    - Automatically handles fetching and pagination of data.
    - Provides default rendering based on the schema but allows overriding with a custom item template for more complex UIs.
    - Integrates with Redux for efficient state management.

### 8. **CRUDModal Component**
- **Purpose**: Provide a modal for creating, updating, or deleting records based on the schema.
- **Props**:
    - `tableName` (string): The table to interact with.
    - `action` (`create`, `update`, `delete`): The type of operation.
    - `recordId` (optional): The ID of the record for update/delete operations.
- **Functionality**:
    - Dynamically generates the modal content based on the schema and action type.
    - Integrates with the database and Redux for creating, updating, or deleting records.

### 9. **RelationViewer Component**
- **Purpose**: Display and manage related records (e.g., viewing orders for a customer, comments for a post).
- **Props**:
    - `parentTableName` (string): The name of the table holding the parent record.
