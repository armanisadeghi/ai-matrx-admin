**Line Range:** 401-600  
**Approach:** Full autonomy with safety constraints  
**Date:** 2026-01-31

## Your Assignment

Process **lines 401-600** of `public/type_errors.json` and fix ALL errors you can safely fix.

## Instructions

1. Read lines 401-600 from `/home/arman/projects/ai-matrx-admin/public/type_errors.json`
2. For EACH error in your range:
   - Analyze the error
   - Read the affected file
   - Decide: Can I fix this safely?
   - **IF YES:** Fix it
   - **IF NO:** Use `any` or `@ts-ignore` with comment
3. Track your work
4. Report back with summary

## Key Rules

- **NO logic changes**
- Use `any` or `@ts-ignore` if you can't fix safely
- Full autonomy within safety constraints
- Process ALL errors in your range
