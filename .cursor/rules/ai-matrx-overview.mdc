# AI Matrx Overview Developer Guidelines

1. AI Matrx has a very large codebase and must be kept clean and organized
2. Uses Next.js 15 with App Router 
3. Redux for state management: @/lib/redux/store.ts
4. Supabse for the database: @/utils/supabase/client.ts

## Folder Structure:
- Small, individual components and hooks can be put into general folders, such as "components" or "hooks"
- Larger "features" that have multiple parts, must have a directory under "Features" where all associated files are kept

Example: "Notes Feature"

Route: app/(authenticated)/notes/page.tsx

NOTE: Avoid local Types for anything that is likely to be used in multiple files. Centralize Types to avoid problems later.

When working on features that are already build, respect whatever folder structure is already in place.
- Never save random files to the root of the project
- Documentation: ONly a SINGLE TASK_STATUS.md file as the ONLY documentation for a feature (Updated Consistently)

React:
- Write high-quality, efficient code
- Create reusable utility functions wherever possible to avoid highly complex hooks
- We have a vast number of high quality reusable components, includig ShadCN and many custom-built items. Find them and use them.

Database:
- Supabase is our primary database.
- Client: import { supabase } from "@/utils/supabase/client";
- Server Client: import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/server'

Modern UI/UX Framework:
- This is an extermely modern application so use modern, professional, beautiful and elegant design principles
- Never use emojis (Use Lucid Icons)
- Never use browser warnings and other outdated things (Use our beautiful custom components)
- Use bg-textured for the main background and check the global css for other color patterns. (Always respect light/dark colors)
- All UI should be created efficiently as to not waste space. Do not use exessive padding, gap and other things that waste space
- All UI must be created properly to maximize space on Desktop and then adjust properly for mobile.
