- Avoid local state for anything that has a Redux Slice.
- Use small state updates directly with useAppDispatch and get small state from dedicated selectors with useAppSelector.
- If the action or selector you need doesn't exist, then offer to create it, but always ask first.

// lib/redux/hooks.ts
'use client';

import { useDispatch, useSelector, useStore } from 'react-redux';
import type { AppDispatch, AppStore, RootState } from './store';

// Use throughout your app instead of plain `useDispatch` and `useSelector`
export const useAppDispatch = useDispatch.withTypes<AppDispatch>();
export const useAppSelector = useSelector.withTypes<RootState>();
export const useAppStore = useStore.withTypes<AppStore>();
