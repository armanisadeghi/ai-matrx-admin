# Batch Triage Workflow

This is a focused triage-only workflow that processes untriaged feedback items in batches of 3. It replaces **Step 1 (Triage)** from the main `feedback-workflow.mdc` rule. For all other steps (working the queue, resolving, etc.), use the main workflow rule.

## Why Batches of 3

Triaging requires reading user descriptions, viewing screenshots, researching code, and writing analysis. Processing 3 items at a time keeps context manageable and prevents quality degradation from trying to juggle too many items.

## The One Command

Run this single command to get your batch:

```sql
SELECT get_triage_batch(3);
```

This returns a JSON object with three sections:

```json
{
  "batch": [ /* 3 full item objects - oldest first */ ],
  "pipeline": {
    "untriaged": 12,       /* total new items remaining */
    "your_decision": 5,    /* triaged, awaiting admin */
    "agent_working": 2,    /* approved, being fixed */
    "test_results": 1,     /* awaiting admin testing */
    "done": 45             /* resolved/closed */
  },
  "other_untriaged": [
    /* brief preview of remaining items beyond the batch:
       id, feedback_type, route, username, description_preview (120 chars),
       has_images, has_admin_notes, created_at */
  ]
}
```

## Workflow

### 1. Get Batch

```sql
SELECT get_triage_batch(3);
```

Read the response:
- **`pipeline`**: Glance at counts for situational awareness. Note how many items are in each stage.
- **`batch`**: These are your 3 items to triage now. Process them in order.
- **`other_untriaged`**: Scan briefly for awareness. Don't analyze these yet — just note any patterns (e.g. "5 more bugs on /notes route" or "admin left notes on 2 items").

### 2. Process Each Item in the Batch

For each of the 3 items in `batch`:

**a) Read the item**
- `description`, `feedback_type`, `username`, and `route`
- **Important:** The `route` field is where the user was when they clicked "Submit Feedback" — NOT necessarily where the bug occurs. Users often report bugs from a different page. Treat it as a weak hint. Determine the actual affected route/files from the description and your own code research.
- Check `admin_notes` — admin may have added context before you saw this
- Check for existing comments: `SELECT * FROM get_feedback_comments('<id>'::uuid);`

**b) View screenshots (if any)**
- If `image_urls` is not null: `GET /api/admin/feedback/images?feedback_id=<uuid>`
- Open signed URLs in browser

**c) Research the code**
- Use explore agents to find relevant files
- Understand the root cause

**d) Compute autonomy score (1-5)**

| Factor | +1 if True |
|--------|-----------|
| From `arman@armansadeghi.com` (lead dev, trusted) | Yes |
| Clearly a bug — app is objectively broken | Yes |
| Not opinion-based — fix is objectively correct | Yes |
| Zero risk of negative side effects | Yes |
| Simple fix — CSS, typo, config, single-file | Yes |

**e) Push triage to DB**

```sql
SELECT * FROM triage_feedback_item(
  '<id>'::uuid,
  'Proposed approach: ...',
  'high',                          -- low/medium/high/critical
  'moderate',                      -- simple/moderate/complex
  ARRAY['path/to/file1.tsx'],
  4,                               -- autonomy score
  'Assessment: ...'
);
```

**f) Auto-approve if score 4-5**

```sql
-- Only for score 4-5
SELECT * FROM set_admin_decision('<id>'::uuid, 'approved', NULL, <next_priority>);
SELECT * FROM add_feedback_comment('<id>'::uuid, 'ai_agent', 'AI Agent',
  'Auto-approved: autonomy score 5/5. Clear bug, safe fix, no side effects.');
```

For score 0-3: triage only, wait for admin decision.

### 3. Get Next Batch

After triaging all 3, run the command again:

```sql
SELECT get_triage_batch(3);
```

If `batch` is empty, triage is complete. Report your summary.

### 4. Summary

After all batches are done, provide a brief chat summary:

- Total items triaged in this session
- How many auto-approved (score 4-5)
- How many need admin decision
- Any notable patterns or concerns
- Current pipeline counts

**All details are in the DB.** Don't reproduce full analyses in chat.

## Quick Reference

```sql
-- Get batch of 3
SELECT get_triage_batch(3);

-- Triage an item
SELECT * FROM triage_feedback_item('<id>'::uuid, 'proposal', 'priority', 'complexity',
  ARRAY['files'], score, 'assessment');

-- Auto-approve (score 4-5 only)
SELECT * FROM set_admin_decision('<id>'::uuid, 'approved', NULL, <priority>);

-- Add comment
SELECT * FROM add_feedback_comment('<id>'::uuid, 'ai_agent', 'AI Agent', 'content');

-- Check existing comments
SELECT * FROM get_feedback_comments('<id>'::uuid);

-- Check work queue priority (for auto-approve numbering)
SELECT COALESCE(MAX(work_priority), 0) + 1 AS next_priority
FROM user_feedback WHERE work_priority IS NOT NULL;
```
