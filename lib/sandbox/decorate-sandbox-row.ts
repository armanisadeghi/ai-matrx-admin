/**
 * Single point of normalization between a raw `sandbox_instances` row and
 * the `SandboxInstance` shape the FE consumes.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *   The orchestrator returns a `proxy_url` on every fresh `SandboxResponse`,
 *   but we deliberately don't persist it (the URL is recomputable from
 *   `${MATRX_<tier>_ORCHESTRATOR_URL}/sandboxes/<sandbox_id>/proxy`). For
 *   weeks the Next.js routes silently dropped that field on the floor —
 *   `await fetch().json() as SandboxInstance[]` made TS happy because the
 *   hand-rolled `SandboxInstance` lied about the DB shape, and `strict:false`
 *   meant the lie was never caught.
 *
 *   Funneling every route through this helper closes that loophole:
 *     - The input type is the DB Row (the source of truth from `pnpm types`).
 *     - The return type is `SandboxInstance` (Row + decorations).
 *     - If the DB drops a column, the Row type changes and every downstream
 *       reference to the dropped column fails to compile.
 *     - If a new decoration is added to `SandboxInstanceDecorations`, every
 *       `decorateSandboxRow()` call site fails until it's filled in.
 *
 * Server-only — never import from a Client Component.
