/**
 * lib/sync/registry.ts
 *
 * Central registry of all sync policies. Phase 1 starts empty — the theme
 * policy is wired in PR 1.B via `styles/themes/themeSlice.ts`.
 *
 * This is the single canonical list the engine, middleware, and SyncBootScript
 * walk. Adding a new persisted/broadcast slice means: (1) export a policy from
 * the slice file via `definePolicy`, (2) add it to this array. Nothing else.
 *
 * Replaces: ad-hoc registration scattered across feature middleware + Provider
 * wrappers. Delete trigger: n/a — this file is permanent.
