/**
 * ExtensionBridgeSubscriber — top-level subscriber that wires the
 * matrx-extend Chrome extension's bridge into this app's window-panels
 * system.
 *
 * Mounted once near the root of the authenticated provider tree (see
 * `app/Providers.tsx`). When the extension publishes an
 * `extension->frontend` envelope with `action: "openPanel"`, this
 * component:
 *
 *   1. Forwards the payload to `handleExtensionOpenPanel(...)`, which
 *      validates and dispatches `openOverlay`.
 *   2. Publishes a `frontend->extension` reply on the same Broadcast
 *      channel, preserving the inbound `requestId` so the extension
 *      SW's pending-promise table resolves cleanly.
 *
 * Why this lives in its own component (not in `useExtensionBridgeChannel`):
 * the hook is generic — every consumer registers its own `onMessage`
 * handler. The window-panels translation belongs at the consumer layer
 * so the hook stays free of feature-specific knowledge.
 *
 * Renders nothing. Cheap to mount: short-circuits when no user is signed
 * in (the underlying hook does too) and listens passively until torn
 * down. Bundles only this file + `openPanelHandler` + the Redux action
 * — no window-panels component code is pulled into the static graph.
