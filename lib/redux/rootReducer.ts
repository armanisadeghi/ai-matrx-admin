// Slim root reducer — entity-free. Used by `makeStore()` in `./store.ts`
// for the ~95% of routes that don't touch the deprecated entity system.
//
// Entity-bound routes (under `app/(legacy)/legacy/*`) use
// `createEntityRootReducer` from `./entity-rootReducer.ts`, which composes
// `slimReducerMap` with the entity slices (`entities`, `entityFields`,
// `globalCache`, `entitySystem`).
//
// See `~/.claude/plans/the-entity-system-which-bubbly-wind.md` for the
// migration that produced this split.
