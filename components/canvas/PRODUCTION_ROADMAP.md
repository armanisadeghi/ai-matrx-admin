# Canvas Persistence System - Production Roadmap

## üö® Critical Issues (Fix First)

### Deduplication Problems
- [ ] **Debug why duplicates are being saved despite content hashing**
  - Check if `content_hash` is being generated correctly
  - Verify hash comparison logic in `canvasItemsService.save()`
  - Test with identical quiz content to ensure only one is saved
  - Add logging to see what hashes are being generated
  - Ensure the hash doesn't include dynamic fields (timestamps, IDs)

- [ ] **Fix hash generation to be deterministic**
  - Current implementation might have ordering issues with JSON.stringify
  - Consider sorting object keys before hashing
  - Test with same content in different order
  - Add unit tests for hash generation

- [ ] **Add unique constraint enforcement**
  - Verify database migration ran successfully
  - Check that `canvas_items_user_content_unique` index exists
  - Test constraint by trying to insert duplicate via SQL
  - Handle constraint violation errors gracefully in UI

### Source Tracking Issues
- [ ] **Connect canvas items to their originating messages**
  - When AI generates canvas content, capture `message_id` from chat
  - Pass `source_message_id` to `openCanvas()` action
  - Store in Redux `CanvasItem.sourceMessageId`
  - Pass to `canvasItemsService.save()` when syncing
  - Verify it's being saved to database

- [ ] **Connect canvas items to chat sessions**
  - Determine how to get current `session_id` (chat conversation ID)
  - Pass `session_id` when opening canvas from chat
  - Store in database for filtering (e.g., "Show all from this chat")
  - Add "View in Chat" link in library to jump back to originating message

- [ ] **Connect canvas items to socket tasks**
  - When AI task completes, capture `task_id`
  - Pass `task_id` from AI response handler
  - Store in `CanvasItem` metadata
  - Use for deduplication check: "Was this task already saved?"
  - Add `getByTaskId()` lookup for auto-recovery

- [ ] **Test full source tracking flow**
  - User sends prompt ‚Üí AI responds ‚Üí Canvas opens
  - Verify `source_message_id`, `session_id`, and `task_id` are captured
  - Click sync ‚Üí Verify all three fields saved to database
  - Reload page ‚Üí Verify can trace back to original chat message

## üîß Core Functionality Fixes

### Auto-Save & Sync Behavior
- [ ] **Decide on auto-save vs manual save strategy**
  - Option 1: Auto-save every canvas item immediately when AI creates it
  - Option 2: Manual save only (current behavior)
  - Option 3: Hybrid (auto-save but allow user to delete before syncing)
  - Document decision in README

- [ ] **Implement auto-save if chosen**
  - Add setting in user preferences: "Auto-save canvas items"
  - Auto-call `canvasItemsService.save()` in `openCanvas` action
  - Show subtle toast: "Auto-saved to library"
  - Mark as synced immediately in Redux

- [ ] **Add "Unsaved changes" indicator**
  - Track if current canvas content has been modified since last save
  - Show yellow dot or "Unsaved" badge in header
  - Prompt before closing canvas with unsaved changes
  - Add "Save & Close" vs "Close without saving" options

- [ ] **Improve sync button feedback**
  - Change icon based on state: CloudOff ‚Üí CloudSync (spinning) ‚Üí Cloud (green)
  - Add progress indicator for large content
  - Show error state if save fails (red CloudOff with X)
  - Add retry button on failure

### Deduplication UX
- [ ] **Improve duplicate detection messaging**
  - Instead of "Already saved", show: "Found existing copy from [date]"
  - Add "View existing" button in toast
  - Add "Save as new copy" option if user really wants duplicate
  - Show diff preview if content differs slightly

- [ ] **Add duplicate merge/replace options**
  - If duplicate found, ask: "Replace existing?" or "Keep both?"
  - If "Replace", update existing item's content
  - If "Keep both", allow save with different title
  - Store version history (optional future feature)

### Canvas Item Metadata
- [ ] **Improve auto-generated titles**
  - For quizzes: Extract first question or topic
  - For iframes: Extract page title from URL or meta tags
  - For recipes: Use recipe name
  - For slideshows: Use first slide title
  - Fallback to current behavior if extraction fails

- [ ] **Add automatic description generation**
  - For quizzes: "10 questions about Biology"
  - For iframes: Show domain and page title
  - For recipes: Show cuisine type or meal category
  - Store in `description` field automatically

- [ ] **Capture thumbnail/preview images**
  - Add `thumbnail_url` field to database schema
  - Generate screenshot of canvas content (use html2canvas or similar)
  - Upload to Supabase Storage
  - Display in library grid for visual browsing
