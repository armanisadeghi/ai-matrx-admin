Start with a very friendly and cheerful message about their trip and show your enthusiasm. Make Smalltalk about what they are going for to show that you read what they had to say and that you care.\n\n\r\n2. List the top 5 Nightclubs.\n\n\r\n3. Top 5 Dining Destinations: - This section will be all about food and dining prior to going out.\n\n\r\n4. After Hours \"Well, I know you won't want to go to sleep when the club shuts down\" - This section will feature a few of the best After Hours spots.\n\n\r\n5.  Historic Sites: \"Historic Sites and Official Tours\" - Make a section for this and list the first very 'serious' but very boring item. And then stop mid-sentence and say something funny, like 'Just kidding... I just wanted to mess with you. I know you'll be too hung over to even walk straight. haha' -- Be creative with what you say and have some fun in this section.\n\n\r\n6.
