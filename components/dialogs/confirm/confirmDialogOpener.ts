/**
 * components/dialogs/confirm/confirmDialogOpener.ts
 *
 * Pure-TS imperative API for the global confirm dialog. Zero React, zero
 * dialog markup — this module is statically importable from anywhere
 * (hooks, utils, Redux thunks, async handlers, sync code, server-passed
 * client data, anything).
 *
 * The host (`ConfirmDialogHostImpl`) registers a controller on mount and
 * unregisters on unmount. Calls made before the host has hydrated queue
 * up and resolve as soon as the host is alive — so a destructive action
 * triggered in the first ~50ms after page load still gets a real
 * confirmation, never a silent default-yes/no.
 *
 * One dialog at a time: concurrent calls queue and present sequentially.
 *
 * See `ConfirmDialogHost.tsx` for the slim shell that mounts the host
 * via `next/dynamic`. See `CLAUDE.md` "Browser dialogs are BANNED".
