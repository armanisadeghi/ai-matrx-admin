      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is the output of: typeof null?",
      "options": ["null", "object", "undefined", "number"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This is a known quirk in JavaScript. typeof null returns 'object' due to a legacy bug that was never fixed for backward compatibility reasons."

      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which method is used to add an element to the end of an array?",
      "options": ["push()", "pop()", "shift()", "unshift()"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What is a closure in JavaScript?",
      "options": [
        "A function that has been closed",

        "A method to end a program"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer (enclosing) lexical scope, even after the outer function has returned."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What does 'use strict' do in JavaScript?",
      "options": [
        "Makes code run faster",
        "Enables strict mode for safer code",
        "Disables all errors",
        "Compiles the code"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "'use strict' enables strict mode, which catches common coding errors and prevents the use of certain problematic language features."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Which of these is NOT a JavaScript data type?",
      "options": ["String", "Boolean", "Float", "Symbol"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "JavaScript has Number (which includes integers and floats), but not a separate Float type. The primitive types are: String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, and BigInt."
