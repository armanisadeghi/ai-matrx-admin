# Multiple Choice Quiz System

A comprehensive quiz system with answer randomization, state management, progress tracking, and export/import functionality.

## Features

### üé≤ Answer Randomization
- **True Randomization**: Uses Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to ensure answers are truly randomized
- **Correct Answer Tracking**: Maintains which answer is correct even after shuffling
- **Unique Per Quiz**: Each quiz instance gets a unique randomization

### üíæ State Management
- **Centralized State**: All quiz state managed through a single `QuizState` object
- **Progress Tracking**: Tracks current question, answers, time spent, and more
- **Results Calculation**: Automatic calculation of score, correct/incorrect counts, etc.

### üì• Export/Import Functionality
- **Download Progress**: Export complete quiz state including randomization and progress
- **Download Results**: Export results with detailed answer review
- **Resume Later**: Import saved progress to continue exactly where you left off
- **Results Review**: Import results files to review past quiz attempts

### üîÑ Retake Missed Questions
- **Smart Retry**: After completing a quiz, retake only the questions you got wrong
- **New Randomization**: Answers are re-randomized for the retake
- **Mode Indicator**: Clear visual indicator when in retake mode

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time Tracking
- **Per Question**: Tracks time spent on each individual question
- **Total Time**: Tracks total time for the entire quiz
- **Time Display**: Human-readable time format (e.g., "5m 23s")

### üìä Performance Feedback
- **Score Percentage**: Overall percentage score
- **Performance Messages**: Contextual feedback based on score
- **Detailed Stats**: Total, correct, incorrect, and skipped questions

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import MultipleChoiceQuiz from '@/components/mardown-display/blocks/quiz/MultipleChoiceQuiz';

const questions = [
  {
    id: 1,
    question: "What is the capital of France?",
    options: ["London", "Paris", "Berlin", "Madrid"],
    correctAnswer: 1, // Index of "Paris"
    explanation: "Paris is the capital and largest city of France."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?",
    options: ["Venus", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn"],
    correctAnswer: 1, // Index of "Mars"
    explanation: "Mars is called the Red Planet due to its reddish appearance."
  }
];

function MyQuizPage() {
  return <MultipleChoiceQuiz questions={questions} />;
}
```

### Question Format

Each question must follow this structure:

```typescript
type Question = {
  id: number;              // Unique identifier
  question: string;        // The question text
  options: string[];       // Array of answer options
  correctAnswer: number;   // Index of correct answer (0-based)
  explanation: string;     // Explanation shown after answering
};
```

## How Randomization Works

1. **On Quiz Start**: When the quiz component initializes, it creates a randomized version of all questions
2. **Shuffle Process**: Each question's options are shuffled using the Fisher-Yates algorithm
3. **Answer Mapping**: The system maintains a mapping between shuffled and original indices
4. **Correct Answer**: The correct answer index is updated to match the shuffled position

Example:
```typescript
// Original question
{
  options: ["Paris", "London", "Berlin", "Madrid"],
  correctAnswer: 0  // Paris is at index 0
}

// After randomization (example)
{
  options: ["Berlin", "Madrid", "Paris", "London"],
  correctAnswerIndex: 2,  // Paris is now at index 2
  originalCorrectAnswer: 0,
  shuffleMap: [2, 3, 0, 1]  // Maps shuffled to original
}
```

## State Management

### Quiz State Structure

```typescript
type QuizState = {
  quizId: string;                      // Unique ID for this quiz instance
  originalQuestions: OriginalQuestion[]; // Original questions from AI
  randomizedQuestions: RandomizedQuestion[]; // Shuffled versions
  progress: QuizProgress;              // Current progress
  results: QuizResults | null;         // Results when completed
  mode: 'normal' | 'retake';          // Quiz mode
  retakeQuestionIds?: number[];       // IDs for retake mode
};
```

### Progress Tracking

```typescript
type QuizProgress = {
  currentQuestionIndex: number;
  answers: Record<number, QuizAnswer>;
  startTime: number;
  lastUpdated: number;
  totalTimeSpent: number;
};

type QuizAnswer = {
  questionId: number;
  selectedOptionIndex: number;
  isCorrect: boolean;
  timestamp: number;
  timeSpent?: number;
};
```

## Export/Import

### Export Formats

#### 1. Complete Progress Export
Includes everything needed to restore quiz state:
- Original questions
- Randomized questions (maintains same answer order)
- Progress and answers
- Time tracking
- Results (if completed)

**Use case**: Save progress to continue later

```typescript
// Triggered by "Download Progress" button
{
  exportVersion: "1.0.0",
  exportDate: 1234567890,
  quizId: "quiz_123_abc",
  quizData: { ... },
  progress: { ... },
  results: { ... }
}
```

#### 2. Results Export
Lightweight export focused on results:
- Results summary
- Answers given
- Detailed question review (questions, answers, explanations)

**Use case**: Save results for record-keeping or review

```typescript
// Triggered by "Download Results" button
{
  exportVersion: "1.0.0",
  exportDate: 1234567890,
  quizId: "quiz_123_abc",
  results: { ... },
  questionsReview: [
    {
      questionId: 1,
      question: "What is...",
      selectedAnswer: "Paris",
      correctAnswer: "Paris",
      isCorrect: true,
      explanation: "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Import Functionality

## Future Enhancements

When you're ready to add database support:

1. Create a `quiz_sessions` table to store quiz state
2. Create a `quiz_results` table to store completed results
3. Add save/load functions that use the existing export/import format
4. The JSON structure is already designed to be database-friendly

Example tables:
```sql
CREATE TABLE quiz_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  quiz_id VARCHAR,
  state JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE quiz_results (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  quiz_id VARCHAR,
  results JSONB,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Tips for AI Model Integration

When using AI models to generate questions:

1. **Vary the correct answer position** in your prompt:
   - ‚ùå "Always put the correct answer first"
   - ‚úÖ "Randomize the correct answer position"

2. **But don't worry** - This system will re-randomize anyway! The built-in randomization ensures truly random answer order regardless of AI output.

3. **Focus on quality** - Spend your effort on quality questions and explanations rather than worrying about answer order.
