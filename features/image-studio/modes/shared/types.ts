/**
 * Shared types for the four Image Studio modes (Convert, Edit, Annotate, Avatar).
 *
 * Every mode follows the same lifecycle:
 *   1. Receive a source (File, URL, or cloud_file_id).
 *   2. Let the user manipulate it.
 *   3. On Save, upload the result via `useUploadAndShare` and report back
 *      with the new cloud file id + share URL.
 *
 * Modes are mounted from full-page routes AND from modal dialogs (e.g. Notes
 * "edit this image" → opens Edit mode in a modal). Both call paths use the
 * same shell component — the routes pass `presentation="page"`, the modals
 * pass `presentation="modal"`.

 * - `url`: an absolute URL the browser can fetch (e.g. share URL,
 *   public S3 URL, AI generation result before save).
 * - `cloudFileId`: an id in the `cloud_files` table — the mode will resolve
 *   it to a public URL and load via the standard cloud-files render path.
