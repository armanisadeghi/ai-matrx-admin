/**
 * DOM-Capture BlockPrinter factory
 *
 * Creates a BlockPrinter that captures a provided DOM element and exports it as PDF.

 * the rendered DOM is the most faithful representation.
 *
 * Usage inside a block component:
 *   const { captureRef, printAction } = useBlockDomCapture('Timeline');
 *   // attach captureRef to the block's root element
 *   // add printAction to customActions or controls

 * while keeping the DOM reference local to the component.
