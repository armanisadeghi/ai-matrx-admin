/**
 * editorState slice — per-conversation IdeState snapshot for the
 * `editor-state` client capability.
 *
 * Mirrors the same source data the legacy `instanceContext` `vsc_*` keys are
 * fed from, but in the structured `IdeState` shape the new capability
 * envelope expects. The `editor-state` provider in
 * `features/agents/redux/execution-system/client-capabilities/` reads this
 * slice on every turn — when present, the agent's request gains
 * `client.capabilities += "editor-state"` and the server brings the
 * `vsc_get_state` tool online.
 *
 * Populated by `useIdeContextSync` in the agent code editor surface. Future
 * surfaces (Chrome extension, desktop) that wire their own ide-aware caller
 * dispatch into this same slice.
