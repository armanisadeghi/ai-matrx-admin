# Tool Registry · Lookups

**Status**: shipped (Phase 1 of the tool-registry redesign)
**Owner**: tool-registry
**Routes**: `/admin/lookups`

## What this is

A single tabbed admin surface for the four lookup tables that the tool-registry
schema (Migrations 0022–0023) is built on. These tables seed the vocabularies
that every other piece of the registry references via FK.

| Tab | Table | PK | Edit frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| UI Clients | `ui_client` | `name` text | rare |
| UI Surfaces | `ui_surface` | `name` text (FK → `ui_client`) | occasional |
| Executor Kinds | `tl_executor_kind` | `name` text | rare (most rows are auto-provisioned per MCP server) |
| Gates | `tl_gate` | `name` text | very rare (read-mostly; gates are defined by matrx-ai code) |

## Entry points

- Page: [app/(authenticated)/admin/lookups/page.tsx](../../../app/(authenticated)/admin/lookups/page.tsx)
- Client component: [features/tool-registry/lookups/components/LookupsAdminPage.tsx](./components/LookupsAdminPage.tsx)
- Service: [features/tool-registry/lookups/services/lookups.service.ts](./services/lookups.service.ts)

## Conventions baked in

- **Surface naming**: `<client>/<surface>` slash form (e.g. `matrx-user/code-editor`). The create-surface form composes this from a client picker + a local-name input; the local name is validated against `^[a-z0-9-]+$`.
- **Soft-delete only**: every row has an `is_active` toggle. Hard `DELETE` is intentionally absent — these tables are FK targets for tools, executors, agents, and surfaces. Deactivate, don't delete; reactivate later. The "Deactivate ui_client" path counts dependent surfaces and surfaces that count in the confirm.
- **No barrel files**: imports go directly to source.
- **No Redux**: the lookups are admin-only and infrequent. `useEffect` + `useState` + the Supabase browser client are enough.
- **Confirms via `confirm()`** from `@/components/dialogs/confirm/ConfirmDialogHost` — never `window.confirm`.

## Seed (applied 2026-05-05 via migration `seed_matrx_frontend_clients_and_surfaces`)

Two clients and 18 surfaces were seeded directly so Phase 2 (tool admin) and Phase 8 (agent shortcuts) both have a populated `ui_surface` table to read from:

- `matrx-admin` — admin portal (4 surfaces: tool-registry, agent-debug, state-analyzer, cx-explorer)
- `matrx-user` — user-facing app (14 surfaces matching the legacy `ShortcutContext` enum minus `general`: chat, notes, tasks, projects, agent-builder, custom-apps, code-editor, documents, data-tables, canvas, dashboard, research, transcripts, scraper)

The `chrome-extension` client and its two surfaces (`/assistant`, `/pilot`) were already present from the backend's own seed.

## Change Log

- **2026-05-05** — Phase 1 shipped. Initial Lookups admin tabbed page + service. Backend seeded `matrx-admin` and `matrx-user` clients and 18 surfaces.
