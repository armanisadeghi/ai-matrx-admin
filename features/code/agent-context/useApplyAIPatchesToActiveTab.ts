/**
 * useApplyAIPatchesToActiveTab
 *
 * Watches the agent stream for `conversationId` and stages every
 * fully-closed SEARCH/REPLACE block in the in-flight assistant text
 * against whichever open editor tab it cleanly matches — in real time,
 * not just at end-of-stream.
 *
 * Streaming contract:
 *   - `parseCodeEdits` is regex-based and only emits blocks once their
 *     closing delimiter has arrived, so partial blocks are ignored
 *     automatically.
 *   - `stagePatches` is idempotent by `${requestId}:${tabId}:${blockIndex}`,
 *     so it's safe to dispatch on every render-block update during
 *     streaming. Already-staged patches are not re-pushed, and
 *     accepted / rejected patches are never resurrected.
 *
 * Per-tab matching, not per-file path:
 *   The agent does not always quote the file path in a structured way.
 *   The SEARCH text is, however, required to be unique inside the file —
 *   so we can locate the target tab by trying to apply each block to
 *   each open tab's buffer and accepting only unambiguous matches.
 *   This also handles the realistic case where the agent edits multiple
 *   open files in one turn.
 *
 * UX contract:
 *   This hook only stages — it does NOT mutate tab content. Tabs that
 *   own a pending patch automatically swap from `<MonacoEditor>` to
 *   `<TabDiffView>` (Cursor-style: the file's own tab becomes the diff).
 *   Acceptance flows through the existing `updateTabContent` → save
 *   pipeline so cloud, library, sandbox, and mock filesystems all work
 *   without a special case.
