/**
 * fsChangesSlice — canonical store for `RESOURCE_CHANGED` stream events.
 *
 * The Python backend emits a single `resource_changed` event on every
 * filesystem mutation the agent performs (matrx-ai's `fs_write`,
 * `fs_patch`, `fs_mkdir` today; future tools layer on without schema
 * changes). The same event shape will eventually carry non-fs kinds
 * (`cld_files`, `sandbox.cwd`, `cache.*` — see the spec at
 * `features/code/SANDBOX_PROXY_AND_FS_EVENTS_FE_INTEGRATION.md`).
 *
 * Responsibilities of this slice:
 *   1. Buffer recent changes (per-sandbox ring) so the UI can show
 *      "recently modified" badges, debug timelines, and conflict toasts.
 *   2. Maintain a fast O(1) lookup from a canonical resource id to the
 *      most-recent change — that's how the editor tab manager decides
 *      whether to refresh or surface a conflict toast.
 *   3. Stay extensible. We branch on `kind` at every consumer; unknown
 *      kinds are stored verbatim (so a future "cld_files" event lands
 *      in the slice with no code changes here) but only `fs.*` kinds
 *      have first-class wiring today.
 *
 * Important: the editor tab refresh logic does NOT live here. This slice
 * is the canonical "what changed and when" log. The hook
 * `useApplyFsChangesToOpenTabs` (in `features/code/agent-context`)
 * subscribes, decides per-tab refresh vs conflict, and writes back
 * through the existing `replaceTabContent` action so the save pipeline
 * stays intact.
