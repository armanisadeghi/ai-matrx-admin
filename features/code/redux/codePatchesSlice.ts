/**
 * codePatchesSlice
 *
 * Pending AI-emitted SEARCH/REPLACE patches against open editor tabs.
 *
 * Stream lifecycle:
 *   1. The agent finishes a turn that contains SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
 *   2. `useApplyAIPatchesToActiveTab` parses the final text via
 *      `parseCodeEdits`, finds which open tab(s) the SEARCH text matches,
 *      and dispatches `stagePatches` once per (tabId, requestId) pair.
 *   3. The pending tray UI lets the user accept / reject individually or
 *      accept-all / reject-all per tab.
 *   4. Accepting applies the patch to the tab buffer (via `updateTabContent`)
 *      so the existing dirty + save pipeline carries the change to disk
 *      (cloud files, library, sandbox FS, mock).
 *
 * The slice itself is dumb: it just holds the staged work. The hook layer
 * owns matching, applying, and reconciling.
