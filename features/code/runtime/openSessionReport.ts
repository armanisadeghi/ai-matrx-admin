/**
 * Best-effort opener for the per-sandbox session report.
 *
 * The matrx_agent daemon writes `~/.matrx/session-report.md` on every new
 * sandbox boot, summarizing the previous session — what was preserved
 * (everything in `/home/agent` thanks to the per-user volume), what was
 * NOT preserved (running processes, env vars, system-wide installs), and
 * whether the prior shutdown was graceful or a crash. See Phase 2 of the
 * persistence plan in matrx-sandbox.
 *
 * On `connect()`, the editor opens this file as a regular tab so users
 * see exactly what the new container inherited from the last one before
 * touching anything. On a brand-new user (no previous session), the file
 * doesn't exist — we silently swallow the 404 rather than spamming an
 * error toast.
 *
 * Intentionally a plain function (no React) so callers can fire it from
 * either a hook effect or an imperative click handler without ceremony.
