/**
 * Returns a callback that opens a file from the active filesystem adapter
 * into a new (or existing) editor tab.
 *
 * Branches on the file's preview profile:
 *
 *   - `code` / `text` / `markdown` / `data` / `spreadsheet` → the
 *     text-read path. Bytes are pulled via `readFile()` and dropped into
 *     a Monaco-backed tab. Files like `.bashrc`, `Dockerfile`,
 *     `Makefile`, `authorized_keys`, etc. all flow through here thanks
 *     to the registry's named-file aliases and the dotfile heuristic
 *     fallback.
 *   - `image` / `video` / `audio` / `pdf` → opens a `binary-preview` tab.
 *     The bytes are NOT fetched here; the `BinaryFileViewer` does that
 *     lazily on mount and creates a `blob:` URL it owns. This avoids the
 *     `read failed (400): File is binary, use encoding=base64` error from
 *     the orchestrator and keeps base64 blobs out of Redux.
 *   - `generic` (archives / 3D meshes / sqlite / office docs / unknown) →
 *     also opens as a `binary-preview` tab. The viewer sniffs the bytes
 *     on mount and offers a "View as text" button when the file looks
 *     printable, so even unrecognized text files have a one-click escape
 *     hatch into Monaco.
