/**
 * Attributes rule
 *
 * Each attribute axis has its OWN per-level table. None is shared with any
 * other axis or any other rule. Tweak any cell freely.
 *
 * Calibration goal:
 *   - Raw Intelligence at MAX should alone push the total into the
 *     "extreme" band — only frontier models can satisfy it.
 *   - Reasoning Ability at MAX is also frontier-class, but a notch lower
 *     because more models offer "high" reasoning than offer max raw IQ.
 *   - Speed at MAX is achievable by many models — it's a constraint but
 *     not a frontier requirement on its own.
 *   - Cost is INVERTED: minimal cost is the hardest ask (eliminates
 *     premium models from contention).
