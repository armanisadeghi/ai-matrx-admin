# FEATURE.md — `agents`

**Status:** `migrating` (active rebuild — see `features/agents/migration/`)
**Tier:** `1` — core of the product
**Last updated:** `2026-04-25`

> This file is the **entry point** for the agents system. The system is large enough that it has its own `docs/` subdirectory with sub-feature docs. Start here, then jump to the relevant sub-doc.

## Purpose

Agents are autonomous AI specialists. The AI Matrx Harness turns a raw model into one by providing persistent context, tool execution, orchestration, and multi-surface invocation. Everything in the product that does AI work is ultimately an agent invocation — Chat, Runner, Shortcuts, Agent Apps, Builder.

---

## The mental model in one page

The system runs in three stages with three consumer surfaces:

1. **Build** — `Agent Builder` (`/agents/[id]/build`) — engineers craft identity, instructions, model, settings, tools, variables, context slots. Every save creates a new version.
2. **Test** — `Agent Runner` (`/agents/[id]/run`) — same runtime as Chat with observability on; can pin any past version.
3. **Consume** — `Chat` (user conversations), `Agent Shortcuts` (click-to-fire invocations with auto-mapped variables), `Agent Apps` (custom UIs for workflows).

### Two invocation payloads — the key distinction

| Surface | Endpoint on first turn | Payload includes | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Builder** | `POST /prompts` | **Full agent definition** (system prompt, model, settings, tools, variables) | Cache-independent raw test — builder must see exactly what the server will run, no hidden state |
| **Runner / Chat / Shortcut / App** | `POST /ai/agents/{id}` | **Agent ID + form values** (variables, context, user input) | Server owns the agent definition; client sends only what changes per call |

After the first turn, everything collapses to `POST /ai/conversations/{conversationId}` (or `POST /ai/chat` for ephemeral). See **AGENT_INVOCATION_LIFECYCLE.md**.

### Variables vs. context slots

- **Variables** are required inputs — missing them leaves the agent confused. Bound by name from `invocation.inputs.variables`.
- **Context slots** are optional, auto-filled from ambient sources (user profile, org, active project, scope mappings). Their absence is graceful.
- **Everything else** is fetched on demand via tool call, not injection.

### Versioning

Every Builder save = new `agent_definition` version. Runner + Chat default to the current pointer. **Shortcuts and Apps pin to a specific version** so embeds never break when the agent evolves. Drift is surfaced in the UI; engineers update on demand. See **AGENT_VERSIONING.md**.

## Entry points

**Routes**
- `app/(authenticated)/agents/[id]/build/page.tsx` — Builder
- `app/(authenticated)/agents/[id]/run/page.tsx` — Runner
- `app/(authenticated)/chat/...` — Chat (🚧 not yet built; legacy at `features/cx-conversation/` + `features/cx-chat/`, deprecated stub at `app/(authenticated)/deprecated/chat/`)
- `app/(authenticated)/ai/agents/[id]/connections` — tool/integration config
- `app/(authenticated)/ai/shortcuts/` — shortcut admin

**API endpoints**
- `POST /ai/agents/{id}` — first turn of a new conversation (agent mode)
- `POST /ai/conversations/{conversationId}` — subsequent turns
- `POST /ai/chat` — ephemeral turns (no DB persistence)
- `POST /prompts` — Builder-mode raw request
- `POST /ai/conversations/{id}/tool_results` — durable + widget tool result submission

**Key thunks** (`features/agents/redux/execution-system/thunks/`)
- `launch-conversation.thunk.ts` — single entry point every surface hands a `ConversationInvocation` to
- `launch-agent-execution.thunk.ts` — low-level launch delegate
- `execute-instance.thunk.ts` — body assembly, fetch, stream parsing (agent mode)
- `execute-chat-instance.thunk.ts` — same but for ephemeral/chat mode
- `resume-conversation.ts` — rehydrate after refresh
- `submit-tool-results.ts` — durable tool call result submission

**Services**
- `features/agents/services/mcp.service.ts` — MCP protocol integration (see `features/api-integrations/FEATURE.md`)
- `features/agents/services/mcp-client/` — MCP client
- `features/agents/services/mcp-oauth/` — MCP OAuth flow

## Data model (Redux — four layers)

All state lives under `features/agents/redux/`. The four layers:

### Layer 1 — Agent Source (static definitions)

| Redux key | Slice | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `agentDefinition` | `agent-definition/` | Master registry — live + version snapshots, per-record fetch status, dirty tracking, field-level undo |
| `agentShortcut` | `agent-shortcuts/` | Stored launch buttons — agentId + scope mappings + display config |
| `agentConsumers` | `agent-consumers/` | Per-UI filter/sort/search state for list views |

### Layer 2 — App Context (external)

| Redux key | Location | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `appContext` | `lib/redux/slices/appContextSlice.ts` | Global scope: org, workspace, project, task IDs. Injected by `assembleRequest()`. |

### Layer 3 — Execution Instances (10 slices, `byInstanceId`)

Ephemeral runtime state. Core invariant: **`agentId` is read exactly ONCE — at instance creation.** After that the instance owns its data; if the definition changes mid-run the instance doesn't notice.

| Redux key | In API body? | Owns |
|---|:-:|---|
| `executionInstances` | No | Shell: agentId, origin, status lifecycle |
| `instanceModelOverrides` | Yes (`config_overrides`) | Model settings snapshot + user deltas |
| `instanceVariableValues` | Yes (`variables`) | Variable defs + resolved values (defaults → scope → user) |
| `instanceResources` | Yes (merged into `user_input`) | Attached files/content with status |
| `instanceContext` | Yes (`context`) | Context slot matches + ad-hoc entries |
| `instanceUserInput` | Yes (`user_input`) | Text + multimodal content blocks |
| `instanceClientTools` | Yes (`client_tools`) | Client-side tool IDs registered for this instance |
| `instanceUIState` | **No** | Display mode, panels, modals, visual state |
| `instanceConversationHistory` | No (server owns it) | Turn history, conversation mode, server conversation ID |
| `activeRequests` | No | Per-request stream state (chunks, status, content blocks, tool lifecycle) |

### Layer 4 — Thunks + aggregate selectors

See `features/agents/redux/execution-system/` and `selectors/aggregate.selectors.ts`.

## Invariants & gotchas

- **`agentId` is read once at instance creation.** Do not re-read during execution. If the agent definition changes mid-run, the instance must not notice.
- **Builder and Runner are not the same payload shape.** Builder ships the full definition; Runner ships only the ID. If you add a field to the agent definition, both paths must be updated — Runner needs server-side handling, Builder needs client-side bundling.
- **Shortcuts and Apps pin to version.** `useLatest: false` + `agentVersionId` is the frozen case. Breaking the version contract breaks every embedded invocation silently.
- **The stream is never paused for widget tools.** Fast + fire-and-forget. Non-widget delegated tools do pause.
- **Ephemeral conversations cannot call `/ai/conversations/{id}` on turn 2** — they must call `/ai/chat` with full accumulated history (there is no DB row to target).
- **Client never sees the system prompt or instructions.** Those are server-owned engineer secrets. The client only gets variable + context slot definitions on agent load.
- **Drift between a pinned Shortcut/App version and the live agent is surfaced in the UI, never auto-resolved.**

## Current work / migration state

Active rebuild governed by `features/agents/migration/MASTER-PLAN.md`. Phase-ordered plan (20 phases). Key context:

- Legacy prompts stack is still wired in some places — do not extend it. See `migration/INVENTORY.md` for the legacy ↔ agent map.
- Phases 16–19 are deletion phases; run last.
- RTK only for new state; extend `features/agents/redux/**`, never create parallel local state.
- Multi-scope (admin/user/org) from day one — Shortcuts, categories, content blocks must all support it.

## Change log

- `2026-04-25` — Barrel import cleanup: external and core callers no longer import `conversation-list`, `message-crud`, `surfaces`, `mcp-client`, or execution-system index folders without a file — use `*.slice`, `*.thunks`, `*.selectors`, `mcp-client/client`, etc. (includes `lib/redux/rootReducer`, `cx-chat/ConversationInput` → `types/instance.types`, MCP API routes, window panels, `packages/matrx-agents` re-exports, and related).
- `2026-04-25` — Variable UI: `VariableInputComponent` now lives in `components/inputs/input-components/VariableInputComponent.tsx` (client); `input-components/index.tsx` re-exports only the leaf inputs (`ToggleInput`, `NumberInput`, etc.) and `useContainerWidth` — importers of the dispatcher use the dedicated file, not the barrel.
- `2026-04-25` — claude: Phase 2 — applied the message UX overhaul to every consumer that shares `AgentConversationColumn` or directly mounts `AgentUserMessage` / `AgentAssistantMessage`. `ChatRoomClient` (chat route) registers `kind: 'page'` with URL `/chat/{conversationId}`. `AgentBuilderRightPanel` registers `kind: 'window'` (test panel switches in place — builder route doesn't carry conversationId). `AgentRunWindow` registers `kind: 'window'`. `AgentChatAssistant` (floating chat-assistant widget) registers `kind: 'widget'` with `customNavigation: true` and on fork spawns a sibling widget for the target conversation while closing itself, preserving the one-widget-per-conversation mental model. `AgentRunnerPage` gained an optional `buildConversationUrl` prop; `CodeWorkspace`'s `ChatPanelSlot` passes one so fork navigation stays at `/code?agentId=X&conversationId=Y` instead of 404'ing on the runner's default `/code/{agentId}/run` pattern. The surfaces thunk now honors a `customNavigation` flag on `window`/`widget` registrations so consumers like the chat-assistant can react to navigation intents without a URL change. `flash-cards/AIChatInterface` is intentionally excluded — it talks to OpenAI directly and does not use the agent system.
- `2026-04-24` — claude: message-level UX overhaul on the runner — fork outcome toast (Go to new branch / Stay here), Edit & Resubmit dialog (Fork vs Overwrite, both auto-submit), per-message Delete dialog (Delete here / Fork without this message, with cascade warning for attached tool calls), and inline Retry button on failed assistant turns. Built on a new central surfaces registry (`features/agents/redux/surfaces/`) so action bars stay surface-agnostic — page consumers register `kind: 'page'` and get a 5-line pendingNavigation effect; window/widget consumers register without one and react to focus updates as before. New thunks (`deleteMessage`, `overwriteAndResend`, `atomicRetry`) are stable; they fall back to per-message soft-delete when the atomic Python RPC `cx_truncate_conversation_after` isn't deployed yet. Python team work captured in [`docs/PYTHON_RESUME_SPEC.md`](./docs/PYTHON_RESUME_SPEC.md). Other consumers (chat, build, AgentRunWindow, widgets) get the new dialogs automatically once they pass `surfaceKey` through `AgentConversationDisplay` and register their surface — separate PR.
- `2026-04-22` — claude: initial FEATURE.md umbrella + new sub-docs (BUILDER, RUNNER, VERSIONING, INVOCATION_LIFECYCLE, ORCHESTRATION, STREAMING_SYSTEM).
- `2026-04-22` — claude: admin surface for system (builtin) agents lives at `app/(authenticated)/(admin-auth)/administration/system-agents/agents/`. Reuses `AgentBuilderPage`, `AgentRunnerPage`, and `AgentCard` from the user-side `(a)/agents/` routes via new `basePath` / `backHref` props on `AgentHeader`, `AgentModeController`, `AgentRunHeader`, `AgentCard`, `AgentListItem`. The admin shell (`ClientAdminLayout`) suppresses its ModuleHeader on builder/runner detail routes so these pages can own the top strip. `SystemAgentsGrid` is a simpler admin-only grid that reads `selectBuiltinAgents` directly. System agent creation goes through `createSystemAgentFromSeed` server action (admin-gated, writes via `createAdminClient` with all scope columns null).

> **Keep-docs-live rule:** after any substantive change to agents — especially to thunks, slice shapes, invocation payloads, or stream event types — update this file, the specific sub-doc it touches, and the Change log. A broken mental model cascades across every parallel agent working on top of it.
