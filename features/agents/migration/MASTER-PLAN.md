# Master Plan — Prompts → Agents Migration

Read [`README.md`](./README.md) before touching anything here. Read [`INVENTORY.md`](./INVENTORY.md) for the legacy surface.

## How to read this file

- Phases are **ordered**. Do not begin a phase until its prerequisites are `complete`.
- Each phase has a dedicated doc in `./phases/phase-NN-<slug>.md`. That doc is the truth for scope and status.
- This file shows goal, prerequisites, status, and next actions. Details live in phase docs.

## Where we are (2026-04-22)

**All foundational phases are shipped to main.** The DB schema for shortcuts, content blocks, agent apps, the execution config bundle, and the feature/binding renames have all landed. Live shortcuts execute end-to-end with variable resolution, context overrides, LLM overrides, bypass-gate timer, and scope/context mappings wired through.

- **Code-and-DB complete (11 phases):** 1, 2 (impl), 3, 3.5, 3.6, 5, 7 (with caveats), 8 (impl), 9, 11, 12, 13
- **Blocked on user decision (3 phases):** 4 (quick actions re-scope), 6 (code-editor agent ids), 10 (applets)
- **Partial (1 phase):** 7 — chat route shipped, community tab stubbed, keybind registry deferred
- **Gated (7 phases):** 14 → 15 → 16 → 17 → 18 → 19 → 20

**Biggest gap right now is end-to-end smoke testing**, not code. Phase 3.5 and 3.6 shipped significant behavior changes (variable resolution precedence, bypass timer, context mappings) that have not been exercised against a live browser session since landing. The Quick Code Explanation shortcut (id `863b28c4-bb94-400f-8e23-b6cf50486537` → agent `acc3b900-e4b2-4000-b0a5-4889d8d33757` v13) is the canonical verification fixture.

## Architecture anchors (apply everywhere)

- **State**: RTK only. Extend existing slices (`features/agents/redux/**`) — never create local/parallel state.
- **Shortcuts are multi-scope from day 1**: admin / user / org. `agx_shortcut` + `shortcut_categories` + `content_blocks` all carry `user_id`, `organization_id`, `project_id`, `task_id`.
- **CRUD components are shared**: built once in `features/agent-shortcuts/`, mounted by admin/user/org routes.
- **Config is unified**: every surface that customizes an agent produces the same `AgentExecutionConfig` bundle (shortcuts, agent apps, tester, inline launches). See `features/agents/types/agent-execution-config.types.ts`.
- **Runtime is separated**: `AgentExecutionRuntime` carries per-invocation data (applicationScope, userInput, widgetHandleId, originalText) — never persisted.
- **Chat is the crown jewel**: `(a)/chat` route exists and runs on the execution-system.

Phase 14 gates everything downstream.
Phase 15 runs once Phase 14 is green.
Phases 16–19 run strictly sequentially after 14+15 green.
Phase 20 is the victory lap.

## Next up — actionable work

### 🟢 What I can ship right now without asking (recommended order)

1. **Phase 3.6 cleanup pass** (~4-6 hours) — optional but finishes the types story.
   - Remove 15 `@deprecated` flat fields from `ManagedAgentOptions`; update the ~28 call sites to use `config: { … }` + `runtime: { … }`.
   - Rename `ManagedAgentOptions.overrides` → `llmOverrides` (4 call sites).
   - Delete the coarse `showVariables` flag; update ~10 callers to set `showVariablePanel` / `showDefinitionMessages` explicitly.
   - Delete the `normalize-managed-options.ts` shim if it becomes a no-op after the sweep.
   - **Cost**: cosmetic, behavior-neutral. Skip if time is better spent testing.

2. **Phase 7 polish** — two small loose ends.
   - Wire the keyboard-shortcut registry so `(a)/chat` respects user keybinds.
   - Flesh out the community tab (listing of shared chats) or remove the stub.

3. **Phase 2.3 content-block perf profile** — short investigative task, documents whether we need virtualization in the picker.

### 🟡 What's productive if the user answers questions

4. **Phase 4 Quick Actions re-scope**
   - Question: keep hardcoded, introduce `app_actions` table (recommended), or polymorphic shortcut table?
   - Unblocks a cleaner Phase 5→6→10 path.

5. **Phase 6 Code Editor quick wrapper**
   - Question: which agent IDs back the V2 / V3 / Compact code editors?
   - Today the V2/V3 loader fails; users are stuck on the live prompt-app path.

6. **Phase 10 Applets capture**
   - Five design questions need answers (composite discoverability, persistence scope, child reuse, guest execution, slot gating).
   - Without answers, implementation is pure speculation.

### 🔴 What needs a browser + live data (user-driven testing)

7. **Smoke-test the execution config wiring** — the biggest gap.
   - Run the Quick Code Explanation shortcut. Verify:
     - `defaultVariables` seed the variable panel.
     - Scope-mapped `selection` / `content` override defaults.
     - `contextOverrides` populate context entries on the instance.
     - `llmOverrides` reach the request body (check Network panel).
     - `showPreExecutionGate` + `bypassGateSeconds` — timer counts down in window title, auto-submits at 0, keyboard/pointer cancels countdown.
     - `hideReasoning` / `hideToolResults` hide the expected blocks.
     - `variablesPanelStyle` renders the selected style.
   - Run `/agents/shortcuts` admin page — edit a shortcut's new fields via ShortcutForm, confirm round-trip.
   - Run `/agent-apps` — create + publish an agent app, load `/p/[slug]` as a guest, confirm Babel sandbox + rate limit trigger both fire.

8. **Phase 7 `(a)/chat` full exercise** — multi-turn chat, tool use, conversation reuse, ephemeral mode.

9. **Phase 8 agent apps end-to-end** — public runner was shipped code-complete but never exercised live.

### ⏳ Blocked on 14

10. **Phase 14 dual-run** — needs Phase 4, 6, 10 closed AND a production soak window (1-2 weeks with a feature flag toggling prompts vs agents).

## Open questions (consolidated)

| # | Phase | Question | Why it matters |
|---|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | 4 | Quick actions: hardcoded / `app_actions` table / polymorphic shortcut? | Unblocks 5→6→10 cleaner |
| 2 | 6 | Which agent IDs back V2 / V3 / Compact code editors? | Today V2/V3 fails at loader |
| 3 | 10 | Applet discoverability — separate list, filter on apps list, or both? | Determines app-list UX |
| 4 | 10 | Applet persistence — local, per-session, or per-user across applets? | Determines DB design |
| 5 | 10 | Child applet reuse — embed-only or standalone-too? | Determines relationship table |
| 6 | 10 | Guest execution — are applets public? | Determines `/p/[slug]` flow |
| 7 | 10 | Context-slot gating — required before run? | Determines launch-guard rules |
| 8 | 14 | Dual-run production soak window length | Determines testing confidence |

## Start here

If you have 15 minutes and want to make progress without decisions: **smoke-test the Quick Code Explanation shortcut** (item 7 above). That single test exercises most of what's shipped since Phase 3.

If you want to answer questions: **Phase 4** is the lowest-effort, highest-unblock. Ten minutes of thought → unblocks a clean Phase 5→6→10 path.

If you want more code shipped: **Phase 3.6 cleanup pass** (item 1 above). Behavior-neutral, improves the type surface, removes the `normalize-managed-options.ts` shim layer.
