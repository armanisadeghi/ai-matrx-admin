# Phase 2 — Content Blocks Migration

**Status:** partially-absorbed-into-phase-1
**Owner:** _unassigned_
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1
**Unblocks:** Phase 3, Phase 5

## Goal

Make content blocks (static, insertable text templates) fully agent-native and neutral: scope-aware, reusable, and decoupled from the prompt feature tree.

## Scope after Phase 1

Phase 1 absorbed most of the original Phase 2 scope:
- ✅ `content_blocks` table got scope columns (was originally a Phase 2 step).
- ✅ `agent_context_menu_view` returns content blocks alongside shortcuts.
- ✅ `features/agent-shortcuts/components/` includes `ContentBlockList.tsx` and `ContentBlockForm.tsx` (built in task 1.7).

**What remains:**

## Success criteria
- [ ] Port text-insertion utilities from `features/prompts/utils/textareaInsertUtils.ts` to a neutral location. Proposal: `utils/text-insertion.ts`. Non-prompt consumers switch to the neutral import.
- [ ] Confirm the `agent_context_menu_view` performance for realistic row counts (e.g. 200 shortcuts × 50 content blocks × 20 categories). Add indexes if slow.
- [ ] All existing content blocks remain visible (migration is additive — they're all global-scope with NULL user_id/org_id).
- [ ] Change log entry here, `MASTER-PLAN.md` status updated.

## Tasks
- **2.1** Port insertion utils. Find every importer of `features/prompts/utils/textareaInsertUtils.ts` and update to the new path. Keep the old file exporting from the new location during the dual-run window (deleted in Phase 18).
- **2.2** View performance smoke test. Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` against `agent_context_menu_view` with a meaningful data set. Add partial indexes if the scan-rate is unacceptable.
- **2.3** Write short dev-doc paragraph in `features/agent-shortcuts/` describing what content blocks are and how they differ from shortcuts (for Phase 3 consumers).

## Out of scope
- Any UI route (Phases 11/12/13).
- The context menu itself (Phase 3).
- Deletion of any prompt-side insertion code (Phase 18).

## Change log
| Date | Who | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-20 | initial plan | Phase created |
| 2026-04-20 | main agent | Phase largely absorbed into Phase 1 after discovery that `content_blocks` already exists. Remaining scope: insertion util port + perf verification. |
