# Phase 9 — Admin Agent Apps Management

**Status:** complete
**Owner:** claude (phase-09)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 8
**Unblocks:** —

## Goal

Mirror `administration/prompt-apps` for agent apps: list, feature/verify, moderate. Reuse shared components from `features/agent-apps/` (Phase 8).

## Success criteria
- [x] Admin route under `app/(authenticated)/(admin-auth)/administration/agent-apps/`.
- [x] Feature flag, verify, deactivate controls.
- [x] Rate limit override UI.

```

## Design summary

**Admin moderation surface.** Shipped a new reusable `AgentAppAdminActions` component under `features/agent-apps/components/` that renders all platform-admin controls: feature, verify, public/private, status dropdown (draft / published / archived / suspended with confirm), rate-limit override form, and delete (with AlertDialog confirm). Suspend + delete gates go through AlertDialog — no native `confirm()`. The component takes an `onUpdate(patch)` callback so admin/user/org scopes can point it at different mutations.

**Service layer.** Added `lib/services/agent-apps-admin-service.ts` — mirrors `prompt-apps-admin-service.ts` 1:1 with helpers for categories (list/create/update/delete), apps (list with `creator_email` join via `get_user_emails_by_ids` RPC, get-by-id, admin-patch), executions (list with app join), errors (list + resolve/unresolve), and rate limits (list + block/unblock). RLS enforces admin-only writes (DB migration policies already gate `agent_apps` mutations to `is_platform_admin()`).

**Reuse of Phase 8 components.**
- `AgentAppsGrid` — mounted in the dashboard for featured + recently-updated sections with `hrefFor` pointing at `/administration/agent-apps/edit/[id]`.
- `AgentAppEditor` — mounted in the edit page under the "Component Code" tab for Babel-editable JSX/TSX.
- `UpdateAgentAppModal` — mounted in the edit page as the metadata (name/tagline/description/status) editor.
- `AgentAppCard` — used transitively via `AgentAppsGrid`.

**Component edit wiring.** The edit page hits `PATCH /api/agent-apps/[id]` (shipped in Phase 8) for component code + metadata saves, and the admin-only fields (`is_featured`, `is_verified`, `is_public`, `rate_limit_*`, `status`) flow through the service function `updateAgentAppAdmin` which hits the table directly (RLS allows it for platform admins).

**Page wrapper** uses the mandated `h-[calc(100vh-2.5rem)] flex flex-col overflow-hidden`. Edit page layout bypasses the admin tab nav (matching the agent-shortcuts pattern — the layout client returns `children` directly on `/edit/`).

**Mobile rules.** Inputs everywhere are `text-[16px]`, nav bar is horizontally scrollable on narrow viewports, and `UpdateAgentAppModal` already uses Drawer on mobile (inherited from Phase 8). Edit page tab nav uses horizontal scroll instead of stacking because there are only two tabs.

## Reuse summary

| Component | Source | Where mounted |
|---|---|---|
| `AgentAppsGrid` | Phase 8, `features/agent-apps/components/layouts/` | Dashboard (featured + recent) |
| `AgentAppEditor` | Phase 8 | `/edit/[id]` — Component Code tab |
| `UpdateAgentAppModal` | Phase 8 | `/edit/[id]` — metadata edit button |
| `AgentAppAdminActions` | **Phase 9 (new)** | `/edit/[id]` — Admin Moderation card |
| `renderIcon` | `components/official/icons/` | Categories page sidebar + preview |
| `matchesSearch` | `utils/search-scoring` | Categories search filter |

## New Phase 9 additions (non-duplicating)

Everything here is new admin-specific glue; nothing duplicates Phase 8 or Phase 11 work.

- `features/agent-apps/components/AgentAppAdminActions.tsx` — reusable admin-scope action bar (feature/verify/public/status/rate-limit overrides/delete). Exported from `features/agent-apps/index.ts`.
- `lib/services/agent-apps-admin-service.ts` — thin Supabase client wrapper. Mirrors the `prompt-apps-admin-service.ts` shape for a painless visual diff.

## Cross-links

- Added a deprecation banner on `app/(authenticated)/(admin-auth)/administration/prompt-apps/page.tsx` pointing to `/administration/agent-apps`. Legacy page preserved — Phase 16 removes it.

## Open items / deferred

- **Rate-limit row table.** Phase 8 tracks per-identifier rate limits in `agent_app_rate_limits`. The executions surface does not yet include a rate-limits table because the first-order admin need (overriding the per-app caps) is solved via `AgentAppAdminActions.showRateLimits`. A follow-up can add an `/administration/agent-apps/rate-limits/` route that uses `fetchAgentAppRateLimits` / `unblockAgentAppRateLimit` / `blockAgentAppRateLimit` (all already in the service).
- **Auto-create app flow.** `CreateAgentAppForm` from Phase 8 requires an `agents: AgentOption[]` prop. A first-class "admin creates new agent app" flow needs an agent-discovery query. Out of scope for this phase — the admin use case is moderating existing user apps, not creating new ones.
- **Types cast.** The service uses `as unknown as any` on the Supabase client in three spots pending DB type regeneration (same pattern Phase 8 used). Will clean up after `npx supabase gen types` runs post-migration.
