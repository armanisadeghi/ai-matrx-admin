/**
 * surfaces slice — central registry for UI consumers of the agent system.
 *
 * Each consumer (a page, floating window, modal, widget) registers itself
 * once on mount with a stable `surfaceKey` and a `kind`. Action bars and
 * other shared components then dispatch surface-agnostic intents (e.g.
 * "navigate to this conversation"); the routing thunk reads the registry
 * to produce the right kind of state update for that surface kind.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *   • Action bars (fork / edit / delete / retry) live inside reusable
 *     components but their "success" looks different per consumer. A page
 *     needs to update its URL; a floating window just changes its own
 *     state; a widget might do nothing or pop the user to the full runner.
 *   • Consumers used to each write their own focus-watching effect with
 *     ad-hoc routing logic. With this registry, every page consumer uses
 *     the same 5-line pendingNavigation effect, and window/widget consumers
 *     don't need any extra effect at all.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   • `kind === 'page'`  — the routing thunk writes pendingNavigation; the
 *                          consumer's effect reads it, calls router.replace,
 *                          and clears it.
 *   • `kind === 'window'` or `'widget'` — the routing thunk dispatches
 *                          conversation-focus `setFocus` directly. The
 *                          consumer is already reactive to focus changes;
 *                          no consumer effect is required.
 *
 * The slice itself is stateless w.r.t. routing — it just stores the
 * registration and the pending-navigation slot. The thunk in
 * request-surface-navigation.thunk.ts owns the dispatch logic.
