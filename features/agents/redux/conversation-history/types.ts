/**
 * conversation-history — reusable multi-agent conversation history slice.
 *
 * This is a `scope`-keyed slice: any UI surface (the /code workspace, a
 * future document editor, a project dashboard, etc.) registers a `scopeId`
 * and gets an independent conversation list — filtered by a set of
 * `agentIds`, paginated, and groupable by date or agent.
 *
 * It sits alongside `conversation-list` rather than replacing it: that slice
 * owns per-agent RPC caches (used by the Runner) and the global user list;
 * this one owns scope-specific views that span multiple agents at once.
