/**
 * Client capability registry.
 *
 * Each surface (code editor, sandbox, future Chrome extension / desktop /
 * mobile) registers a provider that selects its capability payload from
 * Redux state at request-build time. `buildToolInjection` walks the registry

 *
 * Adding a new surface is one file: define a provider that calls
 * `registerClientCapability(...)`, then import the file once from
 * `./register-all.ts` for its registration side-effect.
