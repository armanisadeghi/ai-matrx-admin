/**
 * editor-state capability — bound when a code-editor surface is the active
 * caller. Payload is `IdeState` (active file, selection, diagnostics, git,
 * workspace). Auto-brings the `vsc_get_state` tool online server-side.
 *
 * Reads from `editorState.byConversationId[conversationId]`, populated by
 * `useIdeContextSync` in the agent code editor surface. Returns `null`
 * when no editor data is bound, which keeps the capability out of the
 * request envelope entirely (no false declaration for non-editor surfaces).
