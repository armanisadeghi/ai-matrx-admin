/**
 * Instance Model Overrides Slice
 *
 * Manages the three-state override layer for each instance's model config.
 *
 * CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE RULE:
 * baseSettings is copied ONCE from the agent at instance creation time.
 * No selector should ever reference agentId to look up model settings.
 * If the agent is modified or deleted, this instance is unaffected.
 *
 * Three states for any setting key:
 *   - NOT in overrides AND NOT in removals → untouched (falls through to baseSettings)
 *   - IN overrides → changed to a new value
 *   - IN removals → explicitly removed (the API must not receive this key)
 *
 * The agent's definition slice is NEVER accessed from here.
 * Merging happens only in selectors using the instance-owned baseSettings.
