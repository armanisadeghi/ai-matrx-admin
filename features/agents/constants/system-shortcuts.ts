/**
 * System shortcut registry — hard-coded references to shortcuts that the
 * application code depends on.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ----------------
 * A shortcut lives in the database and owns its agent reference, variable
 * mappings, display mode, and every other knob. Application code normally
 * should NOT know any of that — it should only know the shortcut id.
 *
 * But some features (like the AI Agent Generator) are themselves core
 * product surfaces that ship with a built-in shortcut. For those we need
 * a stable id in source. This registry is that — nothing more.
 *
 * RULES
 * ------
 * - One entry per shortcut the app code references.
 * - `feature` identifies the UI that owns this shortcut. One feature can
 *   own multiple shortcuts (e.g. primary + fallback generators).
 * - `id` is the ONLY thing callers should ever read. Everything else on
 *   the shortcut — agent id, variable mappings, display mode — lives in
 *   the database.
 * - `temporaryConfigs` is a deliberate escape hatch for things that don't
 *   yet live on the shortcut row. It's a REMINDER. Every item in here is
 *   migration debt; the goal is to drain it over time so this object only
 *   ever carries `id`.
 *
 * IF YOU ADD ONE
 * ---------------
 * 1. Create the shortcut in the DB first (via /administration/agent-shortcuts).
 * 2. Copy the id here under the right feature.
 * 3. Add a short description so the next engineer knows what it's for.
 * 4. If you need anything in `temporaryConfigs`, add a TODO linking the
 *    schema work that will move it onto the shortcut record.
