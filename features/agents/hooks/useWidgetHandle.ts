/**
 * useWidgetHandle — register a widget's capability + lifecycle methods.
 *
 * A widget that wants an agent to mutate its state (replace a selection,
 * update a field, attach media, ...) calls this hook once with a WidgetHandle
 * literal. The hook registers the handle with CallbackManager and returns an
 * id to pass on `invocation.callbacks.widgetHandleId`.
 *
 * Key design choices:
 *   - The registered handle is a STABLE WRAPPER that always reads the LATEST
 *     closures off a ref. Callers can pass fresh closures every render
 *     without re-registering (no new id), and new methods added between
 *     renders (e.g. a feature flag enables `onAttachMedia` after mount) are
 *     visible immediately — `deriveClientToolsFromHandle` checks method
 *     existence at assembly time, not at registration time.
 *   - Uses `Object.defineProperty` getters to forward every known method key
 *     (10 action methods + 3 lifecycle methods) to the live ref. This is
 *     the minimum structure that satisfies both `typeof handle[key] ===
 *     "function"` checks and dynamic invocation.
 *   - Unregisters on unmount. A widget that disappears mid-stream leaves
 *     `callbackManager.get(id)` → undefined; the dispatcher treats that as
 *     `{ok:false, reason:"not_found"}` and POSTs back so the loop can
 *     finish gracefully instead of timing out at 120s.
