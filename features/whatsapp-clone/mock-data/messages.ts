const KELVIN_LONG_LIST = `Hey, I appreciate the honest feedback. Looking back, there were several decisions I should have flagged before making them. I had noted them down before I took a brief nap:

1. The studio files were copied, not moved — the original \`features/image-studio/\` folder still exists with duplicate code. When does that get cleaned up, and who approves it?
2. Private images (screenshots, chat uploads) will show a blank state in the image viewer because there's no signed URL fallback. Should that have been in scope for this PR?
3. I simplified the Gallery Window panel without getting approval — if users relied on anything in the old version, that's an unapproved regression.
4. Images uploaded through the Manager default to private visibility, meaning they won't get CDN URLs. Not sure if that's the right call.
5. The Search page lets you click Unsplash results, but nothing happens — I assumed it was okay to leave as a no-op, but that might be wrong.
6. Lastly, the planning docs were never committed to the repo — not sure if they're meant to live there.

I should have raised all of these before making the calls myself. Can we find time to go through them?`;

const ARMANI_RESPONSE = `I need to see what you're talking about with the changes. If you made 100 huge improvements and a few missteps, that's easy to fix. But if we lost features and didn't make a big improvement, then that doesn't work.

Some of what you're saying really concerns me though because you're talking about clicking on images that didn't do anything and I'm not sure if you have fully done everything.

I don't know until I see it.

What I need is to know is this:

1. Is it ready for me to look at?
2. Should I do it on my own or do you want to show me?`;
