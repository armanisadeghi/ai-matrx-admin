/**
 * Tool Call Visualization — Redux selectors.

 * Thin re-exports + small composed selectors built on top of the canonical
 * selectors in features/agents/redux/execution-system/active-requests/.
 *
 * This feature does NOT own tool lifecycle state — it only reads from it.
 * The selectors here provide a stable public API for consumers of the
 * visualization feature so they don't have to reach into the agents
 * internals directly.
