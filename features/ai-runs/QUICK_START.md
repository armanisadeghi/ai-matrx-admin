# AI Runs - Quick Start Guide

## âœ… Status: Ready for Testing

**Phases 1 & 2 Complete** - Core tracking system fully operational!

---

## What Just Got Built

A universal AI conversation tracking system that automatically:
- Creates a `run` record for every conversation
- Creates a `task` record for every request/response
- Calculates costs and performance metrics
- Aggregates statistics in real-time
- Synchronizes with socket.io events

**No manual tracking needed - it all happens automatically!**

---

## Quick Test (30 seconds)

1. **Start a Prompt Run:**
   - Go to any prompt
   - Click "Run"
   - Send a message

2. **Check the Database:**
```sql
-- See your latest run
SELECT * FROM ai_runs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- See the tasks
SELECT * FROM ai_tasks ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

3. **Send More Messages:**
   - Continue the conversation
   - Watch the counts update automatically!

```sql
-- Watch it increment
SELECT 
  name,
  message_count,
  task_count,
  total_tokens,
  total_cost
FROM ai_runs 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

## Integration Points

### PromptRunner (âœ… Complete)
```typescript
// Automatic tracking in PromptRunner:
- createRun() on first message
- createTask() before each socket submission
- updateTask() during streaming (debounced)
- completeTask() when response ends
- addMessage() for both user and assistant
```

### Socket.io (âœ… Complete)
```typescript
// Modified submitTaskThunk.ts:
- Added optional customTaskId parameter
- Non-breaking change
- Perfect synchronization with database
```

---

## What's Tracked

### Per Run (ai_runs table)
- Conversation metadata (name, source)
- All messages with timestamps
- Variable values
- Model settings snapshot
- **Auto-aggregated:**
  - Total tokens used
  - Total cost
  - Message count
  - Task count

### Per Task (ai_tasks table)
- Request/response pair
- Provider, endpoint, model details
- Full request payload
- Streaming responses
- Performance metrics (TTFT, total time)
- Token usage
- Cost calculation

---

## Database Magic ðŸŽ©

### Automatic Triggers
When a task completes, the database **automatically**:
1. Increments `ai_runs.task_count`
2. Adds to `ai_runs.total_tokens`
3. Adds to `ai_runs.total_cost`
4. Updates `ai_runs.last_message_at`
5. Updates `ai_runs.updated_at`

**No application logic needed!**

### Automatic Timestamps
- `created_at` - Set on insert
- `updated_at` - Updated on every change
- `completed_at` - Set when task completes
- `last_message_at` - Set when messages update

---

## Example Queries

### View Your Latest Runs
```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  message_count,
  total_tokens,
  total_cost,
  last_message_at
FROM ai_runs
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY last_message_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Get Full Run with Tasks
```sql
-- Get run
SELECT * FROM ai_runs WHERE id = '<run_id>';

-- Get all tasks
SELECT 
  service,
  task_name,
  model,
  tokens_total,
  cost,
  time_to_first_token,
  total_time
FROM ai_tasks
WHERE run_id = '<run_id>'
ORDER BY created_at;
```

### Your Monthly Usage
```sql
SELECT 
  SUM(total_tokens) as tokens,
  SUM(total_cost) as cost,
  COUNT(*) as runs
FROM ai_runs
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  AND created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW());
```

## What's Next?

### Phase 3: UI Components (Not Started)
Build the user-facing components:
- Runs list sidebar
- Resume conversation functionality
- Run management (rename, delete, star)

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish (Not Started)
- Comprehensive testing
- Error handling improvements
- Performance optimization
- Loading states

### Future Features
- Share runs
- Export data
- Analytics dashboard
- Cost alerts
- A/B testing

## Need Help?

**Documentation:**
- `docs/AI_RUNS_UNIVERSAL_SYSTEM.md` - Full architecture
- `features/ai-runs/README.md` - Feature overview
- `features/ai-runs/READY_FOR_TESTING.md` - Testing guide

**Common Issues:**
1. **Tables don't exist:** Run `docs/ai-runs-schema.sql`
2. **No data showing:** Check RLS policies and authentication
3. **Aggregations wrong:** Check database triggers
4. **Task ID mismatch:** Check socket.io sync
