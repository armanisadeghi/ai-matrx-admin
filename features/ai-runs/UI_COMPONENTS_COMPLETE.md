## 📊 Current Flow

### 1. User Runs Prompt
```
1. User goes to prompt run page
2. Sidebar loads showing previous runs
3. User sends first message
4. Run is created automatically
5. Run appears in sidebar immediately
6. Stats update in real-time
```

### 2. User Views All Runs
```
1. User navigates to /ai/runs
2. See overview stats
3. Browse/search/filter runs
4. Click a run to continue
5. Routes to appropriate page
```

### 3. User Stars a Run
```
1. Click star icon on any run
2. Star state toggles instantly
3. Run updates in database
4. Can filter by starred only
```

---

## 🎯 What's Next (Resume Functionality)

### To Implement Resume:
1. Load run data when `runId` query param is present
2. Populate messages from `run.messages`
3. Set variable values from `run.variable_values`
4. Set model settings from `run.settings`
5. Allow user to continue conversation
6. Create new tasks that link to same run

### Implementation Plan:
```typescript
// In PromptRunner
useEffect(() => {
  const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const runId = urlParams.get('runId');
  
  if (runId && !run) {
    // Load and resume the run
    loadRun(runId);
  }
}, []);

async function loadRun(runId: string) {
  const existingRun = await aiRunsService.get(runId);
  if (existingRun) {
    // Set state from run
    setConversationMessages(existingRun.messages);
    setVariableDefaults(existingRun.variable_values);
    // ... etc
  }
}
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### For Users
```
"I want to see my conversation from yesterday"
→ Go to /ai/runs
→ Search or scroll to find it

```

### For Analytics
```sql

SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  source_type,
  message_count,
  total_cost,
  is_starred,
  last_message_at
FROM ai_runs
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY last_message_at DESC;
```
