 *  - prePopoutRect save/restore round-trip
 *  - activePipWindowId single-slot enforcement
 *  - setPopoutCandidate flag toggle
 *  - unregisterWindow clears popout slot/candidate
 *  - minimizeWindow / minimizeAll skip popped-out windows
 *  - arrangeActiveWindows skips popped-out windows
 *  - restoreWindowState coerces popoutMode to null
