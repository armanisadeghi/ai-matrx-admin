# Task Management System - Complete Audit

## Database Schema vs Implementation Status

### ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

#### `projects` Table
```sql
- id (uuid, PK)
- name (text)
- description (text, nullable)

```

**Status:** ⚠️ Basic CRUD only

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. **Auto-Save Performance Disaster**
**Location:** `features/tasks/components/TaskDetails.tsx`

```tsx
// Lines 31-34 - SAVES ON EVERY KEYSTROKE!
<textarea
  value={task.description}
  onChange={(e) => updateTaskDescription(task.projectId, task.id, e.target.value)}
  // ↑ This fires a database update on EVERY character typed
/>
```

**Problems:**
- Fires database UPDATE on every single keystroke
- Causes unnecessary database load
- Poor user experience (laggy typing)
- Wastes database resources
- Can cause race conditions with fast typing

**Should be:**
- Debounced save (wait 1-2 seconds after user stops typing)
- OR save on blur (when user clicks away)
- OR manual save button
- OR combination of auto-save on blur + debounce

---

### 2. **Missing Edit Functionality**
**Issue:** Can't edit task title after creation

**Current State:**
- Task title is displayed but not editable
- Only description and due date can be edited
- Must delete and recreate to fix typos

**Missing:**
- Inline title editing
- Edit mode toggle
- Save/cancel buttons for title edits

---

### 3. **No Project Editing**
**Issue:** Can't rename or edit project after creation

**Missing:**
- Edit project name
- Edit project description
- Must delete and recreate to fix mistakes

---

### 4. **Poor Empty States**
**Issues:**
- Empty task list shows nothing helpful
- No guidance on what to do next
- Filtering with no results shows blank screen

**Missing:**
- Helpful empty state messages
- Quick action buttons in empty states
- Visual indicators of filtered state

---

### 5. **No Task Reordering**
**Issue:** Tasks are always sorted by creation date

**Missing:**
- Drag and drop reordering
- Custom sort options (priority, due date, alphabetical)
- Manual ordering/position field

---

### 6. **No Task Priority**
**Issue:** All tasks are equal priority

**Missing:**
- Priority field (low, medium, high, urgent)
- Priority indicators/colors
- Sort by priority option

---

### 7. **No Task Search**
**Issue:** Can't search tasks by title or description

**Missing:**
- Search input
- Real-time search filtering
- Search across all projects

---

### 8. **No Bulk Operations**
**Issue:** Must handle tasks one at a time

**Missing:**
- Select multiple tasks
- Bulk complete/delete
- Bulk move to different project
- Bulk status updates

---

### 9. **No Keyboard Shortcuts**
**Issue:** Mouse-only interface

**Missing:**
- `Ctrl+Enter` to add task
- `Esc` to cancel/close
- Arrow keys for navigation
- Quick complete with keyboard

---

### 10. **No Undo/Redo**
**Issue:** Accidental deletions are permanent

**Missing:**
- Undo delete task
- Undo complete task
- Undo bulk operations
- Action history

---

### 11. **No Task Templates**
**Issue:** Must recreate common tasks manually

**Missing:**
- Save task as template
- Quick create from template
- Template library

---

### 12. **No Notifications**
**Issue:** No reminders or alerts

**Missing:**
- Due date reminders
- Overdue notifications
- Assignment notifications
- Comment notifications

---

### 13. **No Data Validation**
**Issues:**
- Can create tasks with only whitespace
- Can set due dates in the past without warning
- No max length on descriptions

---

### 14. **No Loading States**
**Issues:**
- No spinners during operations
- No optimistic updates
- Operations feel slow

---

### 15. **No Error Recovery**
**Issues:**
- Failed operations just show toast
- No retry mechanism
- No offline support

## 📝 Notes

- The current system is **MVP level** at best
- Core functionality works but lacks polish
- **Critical performance issue** with auto-save
- Missing 60% of database schema features
- No user assignment/collaboration features
- Would not pass professional code review

**Bottom Line:** This is a working prototype that needs significant development to be production-ready.
