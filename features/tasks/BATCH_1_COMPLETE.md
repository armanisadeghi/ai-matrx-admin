## Performance Improvements

### Before:
- ‚ùå Database update on EVERY character typed
- ‚ùå If typing 20 characters = 20 database calls
- ‚ùå Laggy typing experience
- ‚ùå Wasted database resources
- ‚ùå Potential race conditions

### After:
- ‚úÖ Database update only after user stops typing
- ‚úÖ Typing 20 characters = 1 database call (after 1.5s pause)
- ‚úÖ Smooth typing experience
- ‚úÖ Efficient database usage
- ‚úÖ No race conditions

**Result:** ~95% reduction in unnecessary database calls! üéâ
