/**
 * features/files/redux/rag-thunks.ts
 *
 * Batch-prefetch the per-file RAG status (whether a `processed_documents`
 * row exists for the file) and mirror it into Redux. The Python backend
 * exposes RAG state through `/files/{file_id}/document` — one request per
 * file — so we wrap that with a concurrency-capped fan-out + a Redux
 * mirror so the file-table column can react instantly when each answer
 * lands.
 *
 * Why a thunk and not just N hooks:
 *   - The file-table renders rows lazily (windowed). Driving status off
 *     a per-row hook would only fetch what's currently scrolled into
 *     view. The user wants to filter by status, so we need answers for
 *     every row in the current dataset, not just the visible window.
 *   - Module-level memoisation in `lookupFileDocument` already de-dups
 *     in-flight calls; this thunk just orchestrates them, throttles to
 *     a polite 8-way parallelism, and reports progress through the
 *     `isFetching` flag so the UI can render a spinner.
 *
 * Skipping & forcing:
 *   - In default (non-force) mode we skip files whose status is already
 *     `indexed` / `not_indexed` — they don't change without a `/rag/ingest`
 *     call we know about. `pending` and `unknown` *do* get re-fetched
 *     because they're inconclusive.
 *   - In `force` mode we wipe the module cache for every requested id
 *     before re-issuing the lookup. This is what the column header's
 *     "Refresh" button calls.
