/**
 * features/files/utils/checksum.ts
 *
 * Client-side SHA-256 hashing for upload files. Mirrors the algorithm
 * the Python backend uses to compute `cld_files.checksum` so the two
 * values are directly comparable — meaning we can detect "user is
 * uploading bytes we already have" before issuing the upload.
 *
 * Implementation details:
 *   - Uses the browser's native `crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", …)`
 *     which is hardware-accelerated on every modern browser. Hashing
 *     a 100 MB file is ~60–200 ms on a typical laptop — fast enough
 *     to do synchronously before showing the duplicate dialog.
 *   - Hashes are cached on the File object via a WeakMap so dropping
 *     the same File twice (e.g. user drops then changes their mind
 *     about the dialog and tries again) doesn't re-hash.
 *
 * Intentionally NOT streaming — we read the whole ArrayBuffer up
 * front. For files >500 MB consider streaming with `crypto.subtle`
 * + a chunked Web Worker; not in scope until users actually hit it.
 */

/**
 * Compute the lowercase hex SHA-256 of a File. Cached per-File. Falls

 * (very old browsers, http: contexts) — callers should treat `null`
 * as "couldn't dedupe; proceed with the upload as-is."
