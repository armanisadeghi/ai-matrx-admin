/**
 * features/files/components/surfaces/FilesUrlSync.tsx
 *
 * Render-less Redux ↔ URL bridge for the `/files` route family.
 *
 * Responsibility split:
 *
 *   - URL → Redux  (one-shot, on mount):
 *       Server route pages parse `searchParams` into a `uiPatch` and
 *       pass it to `PageShell` as `initialUiPatch`. PageShell applies
 *       that via the `useOneShotUiHydration` hook below — NOT this
 *       component. The reason: server-rendered HTML must match the
 *       URL on first paint, and the `searchParams` API is only
 *       available in Server Components.
 *
 *   - Redux → URL  (continuous, this component):
 *       This component subscribes to the relevant Redux UI selectors
 *       and writes them back to `?…` via `router.replace` whenever
 *       the user changes anything. It uses `replace` (not `push`) so
 *       a back-button press doesn't get polluted by every filter
 *       toggle. Folder NAVIGATION (which rewrites the pathname) lives
 *       in `PageShell.handleSelectFolder` and uses `router.push` so
 *       back/forward navigates folder history naturally.
 *
 *   - The component is intentionally render-less — drop it once into
 *     `PageShell` and forget about it.
