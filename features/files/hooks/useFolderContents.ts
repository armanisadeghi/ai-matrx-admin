/**
 * features/files/hooks/useFolderContents.ts
 *
 * Returns the normalized children of a folder (files + subfolders), sorted
 * per UI settings. Triggers a fetch if the folder hasn't been fully loaded
 * yet, AND when a previously-loaded folder is re-opened after the
 * staleness TTL has elapsed (default 60 s).
 *
 * Why we need a TTL: realtime covers the optimistic case (current tab
 * sees writes immediately), but two situations leak through:
 *   1. The user navigates away from a folder, another user adds a file,
 *      and the realtime channel was paused / disconnected during the gap.
 *   2. The user reopens after a long idle — even with a healthy channel,
 *      they expect a fresh view.
 *
 * The slice's `fullyLoadedFolderIds` map only tracks a boolean. We layer
 * a module-level `lastLoadedAt` map on top so we don't have to change
 * the slice shape (and risk breaking middlewares that depend on it).
