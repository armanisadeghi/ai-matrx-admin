# PromptRunnerModal - Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Scrolling and Input Position
**Problem:** Input was scrolling with content instead of staying fixed at bottom.

**Solution:**
- Parent container uses `relative` positioning
- Input uses `absolute bottom-0` positioning
- Messages container has `pb-64` to account for fixed input
- Messages now properly scroll behind the input

### 2. âœ… Canvas Layout with Resizable Divider
**Problem:** Canvas didn't have the adjustable separator/divider like in PromptRunner.

**Solution:**
- Integrated `AdaptiveLayout` component (same as PromptRunner)
- AdaptiveLayout provides the resizable divider on desktop automatically
- Canvas now has proper border and adjustment handle
- Matches the exact UI design from PromptRunner

### 3. âœ… Canvas Header Alignment
**Problem:** Canvas was overlapping the modal header.

**Solution:**
- Header is now outside AdaptiveLayout
- AdaptiveLayout wraps only the content area
- Canvas aligns with messages top, header stays separate
- Proper flex layout structure

### 4. âœ… Canvas State Management
**Problem:** Canvas seemed to create new instances instead of persisting state.

**Solution:**
- Now uses Redux canvas state through `useCanvas` hook properly
- AdaptiveLayout subscribes to canvas state from Redux
- Canvas toggle button only shows when `canvasContent` exists
- Desktop: Toggle just opens/closes existing canvas
- Mobile: Manages fullscreen canvas view
- No more duplicate canvas instances

### 5. âœ… Escape and Click Outside
**Problem:** Modal didn't close properly with escape or outside click.

**Solution:**
- Removed `onPointerDownOutside` preventDefault
- Dialog now respects default behavior
- Escape key works
- Click outside closes modal

### 6. âœ… Canvas Toggle Icon Spacing
**Problem:** Canvas toggle icon overlapped with built-in X button.

**Solution:**
- Added `mr-10` margin to button container
- Gives proper space for built-in close button
- Icons don't overlap anymore

### 7. âœ… Auto-Run Mode Behavior
**Problem:** First user message was showing in auto-run mode.

**Solution:**
- Added `shouldDisplayUserMessage` flag
- Auto-run mode hides first user message
- User only sees assistant's response streaming in
- Then continues as normal chat

### 8. âœ… Hidden Variables Mode
**Problem:** Hidden variables mode didn't allow optional user input before running.

**Solution:**
- Created `AdditionalInfoModal` component
- Shows before main modal opens
- User can optionally add instructions
- Can skip to run immediately
- Clean UX with "Skip" and "Continue" buttons

### 9. âœ… Message Width Constraint
**Problem:** Messages were full width instead of constrained.

**Solution:**
- Wrapped messages in centered flex container
- Applied `max-w-[800px]` to messages
- Matches exact width from PromptRunner
- Proper centering on larger screens

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```
