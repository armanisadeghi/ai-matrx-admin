            <p>
              Matrx Extend (the &ldquo;extension&rdquo;) is an opt-in browser
              workspace published by AI Matrx. It lets a signed-in user capture,
              structure, and analyze content from web pages they themselves
              choose to inspect — and connects those workflows to the user&rsquo;s
              own Matrx account.
            </p>
            <p>
              This policy describes only the extension&rsquo;s data practices.
              The broader AI Matrx website and platform are covered by the{" "}

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Single purpose</h2>
            <p>
              The single purpose of Matrx Extend is to give a signed-in Matrx
              user a side-panel workspace to chat with their agents, run tasks,
              capture page content on demand, define reusable structured-data
              extraction patterns, and audit pages for SEO — using only pages
              the user explicitly opens and explicitly acts on.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="space-y-3">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">What the extension accesses</h2>
            <p>The extension only accesses data when a user takes a deliberate action in the side panel, popup, or context menu. It does not run in the background scanning or collecting data from sites the user visits.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>Account information.</strong> Your Matrx user identity
                (email and the OAuth tokens issued by Supabase) is stored
                locally in <code>chrome.storage</code>, with the refresh token
                AES-GCM-encrypted at rest. These tokens are used to authenticate
                requests to your own Matrx account and are not shared with any
                third party.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Page content you choose to capture.</strong> When you
                click an action such as &ldquo;Scrape this page&rdquo;,
                &ldquo;Run SEO audit&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Extract data&rdquo;, the
                extension reads the current tab&rsquo;s DOM (text, images,
                links, structured data) and sends a cleaned representation to
                your Matrx account. We do not capture pages you have not asked
                to capture.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Chat input you provide.</strong> Messages you type into
                the Chat tab, plus any context you explicitly attach (for
                example, the current page title and URL), are sent to your
                Matrx backend so your selected agent can respond. Conversation
                history is stored under your account.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Saved extraction patterns.</strong> Patterns you define
                in the Data tab — selectors, field names, the URL or domain
                they apply to — are saved to your Matrx account so they can be
                reapplied on future visits.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Local preferences.</strong> Settings such as your
                preferred backend environment, UI state, and pairing tokens for
                an optional local desktop companion app are stored in{" "}
                <code>chrome.storage</code> on your machine.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>We do not train AI models on your data.</strong>{" "}
                Content captured through the extension is stored in your
                account so you can use it. It is not used to train, fine-tune,
                or improve any model — ours or anyone else&rsquo;s.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>We do not sell or rent your data</strong> to data
                brokers, advertisers, or any third party.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>We do not use your data for advertising,</strong>{" "}
                including personalized advertising, profiling, or
                creditworthiness determinations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>We do not run background scraping.</strong> The
                extension only reads page content in response to an explicit
                user action; there is no silent crawling, no automatic
                background submission of browsing activity, and no telemetry on
                pages you have not chosen to act on.
              </li>

                except (a) with your affirmative consent, (b) as required for
                security or fraud investigation, or (c) to comply with
                applicable law.

              <li>
                <strong>Supabase</strong> (operated by AI Matrx) — for
                authentication and direct, row-level-secured reads/writes of
                your saved captures, patterns, conversations, and audits.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Matrx backend</strong> at{" "}
                <code>server.app.matrxserver.com</code> — for agent execution,
                streaming responses, and server-side processing of scrape and
                SEO workflows.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              No other third-party services receive your captured content. If
              you have paired the optional Matrx desktop companion app, the
              extension may communicate with it locally on your machine; that
              traffic does not leave your device.

              <li>
                <strong>Host access (<code>&lt;all_urls&gt;</code>).</strong>{" "}
                Required because users decide which pages to scrape, audit, or
                extract structured data from — the extension cannot know in
                advance which sites a user will work with. Content scripts are
                only injected when the user explicitly clicks an action; the
                extension does not run on, observe, or transmit data from pages
                the user has not chosen to act on.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>activeTab + scripting.</strong> Used to inject the
                scrape collectors and the structured-data picker into the
                current tab when the user triggers them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>storage.</strong> Persists your session tokens,
                preferences, and cached extraction patterns locally in{" "}
                <code>chrome.storage</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>sidePanel.</strong> Renders the extension&rsquo;s
                primary UI as a Chrome side panel.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>identity.</strong> Powers the OAuth sign-in flow via{" "}
                <code>chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow</code> against the
                Matrx Supabase auth endpoint.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>offscreen.</strong> Holds long-running fetch/SSE
                streams (agent responses, scrape pipelines) so they are not cut
                off when Chrome suspends the service worker.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>nativeMessaging.</strong> Optional. When the user has
                installed the Matrx desktop companion app, the extension uses
                native messaging to talk to it locally for advanced
                file-system-aware workflows. The extension functions fully
                without it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>alarms.</strong> Schedules a token refresh ahead of
                expiry so the user does not have to re-authenticate every
                hour.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>contextMenus.</strong> Adds right-click actions for
                sending the current page or selected text into the extension.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>clipboardWrite.</strong> Lets the user copy extracted
                content (Markdown, JSON, etc.) to the clipboard.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>downloads.</strong> Saves user-initiated exports of
                captured data to the user&rsquo;s local file system.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>webNavigation.</strong> Detects tab navigation events
                so the extension can recognize when the user has returned to a
                page that already has a saved extraction pattern.
