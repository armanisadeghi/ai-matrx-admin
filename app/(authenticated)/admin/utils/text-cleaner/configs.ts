I have light/dark mode and my theme sets colors so do not hard-code any colors. The key is that you must make sure that you generate the component as a fully reusable component. Do not hard-code anything. Do not hard code the things it needs to function. Get them all as props. At the same time, the component should be totally self-reliant so make as many props as possible optional and ensure the component can manage itself. That includes all actions the component might need. Do not rely on the parent component for state management or for triggering actions. Everything must be able to be controlled internally, with no outside control. But again, if the parent component wants to take control of all of those things, then you must make props available to make that happen.",

If you assign a color, in tailwind, remember that you must also provide a color for 'dark:' or use any of the css variables such as --background, --foreground, --card, --card-foreground, --primary, and many other usual ones you already know from shadcn/ui. the other Lets make this really amazing please.
