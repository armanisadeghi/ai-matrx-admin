# ✅ Canvas Sharing Fixes - Complete!

## All Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Production URL Fixed
**Problem**: Share links used `localhost:3000` instead of production domain

**Solution**: 
- Updated to always use `https://www.aimatrx.com` for share links
- Can be overridden with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable
- Share links now work correctly even when created in development

**Code**: `hooks/canvas/useCanvasShare.ts`
```typescript
const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || 'https://www.aimatrx.com';
const url = `${baseUrl}/canvas/shared/${shareToken}`;
```

### 2. ✅ Share URL Input Width Fixed
**Problem**: Share URL input was too narrow to show full URL

**Solution**:
- Added `flex-1` to input to take all available space
- Added `min-w-0` to prevent text overflow
- Added `whitespace-nowrap` to button
- Input now expands to show as much of the URL as possible

**Code**: `components/canvas/social/CanvasShareSheet.tsx`
```typescript
<div className="flex gap-2 w-full">
  <Input className="flex-1 font-mono text-sm min-w-0" ... />
  <Button className="flex-shrink-0 whitespace-nowrap" ... />
</div>
```

### 3. ✅ Duplicate Route Error Fixed
**Problem**: Two pages at same path caused Next.js routing conflict
- `app/(public)/canvas/shared/[token]/page.tsx` ← New (correct)
- `app/canvas/shared/[token]/page.tsx` ← Old (conflicting)

**Solution**:
- Deleted old route: `app/canvas/shared/[token]/page.tsx`
- This was using the old canvas system (`canvasItemsService`)
- New route uses the proper social sharing system

**Result**: No more routing conflicts!

## 📊 Console Logging (For Debugging)

When you share, console shows:
```
🚀 Starting share creation...
📝 Canvas Type: iframe (or whatever type)
📦 Canvas Data Type: object
👤 User: [user-id] or Anonymous
🔗 Generated share URL: https://www.aimatrx.com/canvas/shared/[token]
💾 Inserting to database: {...}
✅ Share created successfully: {...}
🎉 Share mutation success: {...}
```

If anything fails, you'll see:
```
❌ Database error: {...}
💥 Share mutation error: {...}
```

---

## 🎯 Environment Variable (Optional)

If you want to use a different domain, add to `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-custom-domain.com
```

Otherwise, it defaults to `https://www.aimatrx.com`
