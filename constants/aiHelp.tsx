                   There are some general chat options under the input container that allow the user to select an overall style that will be used for the conversation with the AI Model.
                   Overall options include:
                   - Text Generation: A standard chat.
                   - Image Generation: User provides descriptions of images to be generated.
                   - Video Generation: User provides descriptions of videos to be generated.
                   - Deep Research: Conduct a thorough, deep research project to completely analyze a topic and provide the results and the references.
                   - Brainstorming: Work through complex patterns to brainstorm about something in a multi-turn conversation.
                   - Data Analysis: The user provides data that the AI Model analyzes in detail.
                   - Running powerful AI Agent Recipes: Run a pre-defined set of tools.
                   - Working directly with an AI Model who specializes in specific coding skills such as programming languages, libraries and packages.
                   Inside of the input container, they have options which will remain available to them after starting a chat, including adding attachments, enabling search, thinking, planning, question asking, tools, and audio.
                   - Attachments: allow a user to attach images, videos, pdf or any file for context.
                   - Search: Gives the AI Model the ability to search the web.
                   - Thinking: Triggers a special feature where the model will think through the request prior to providing the final response.
                   - Planning: This utilizes an option where the model will propose a plan to the user. Upon acceptance, the model will work through the plan in a multi-turn process.
                   - Question Asking: This special feature triggeres the model to ask questions for ANYTHING that is not clearly provided by the user. Questions are displayed as UI elements and the answers go back to the model.
                   - Tools: Allows the user to select from a long list of tools that convert the AI Model into an AI Agent and give it the autonomy of using those tools, when necessary.
                   - Audio: Allows the user to speak to the model using their voice, instead of just typing.
                   - Model Selection: Allows the user to select the AI model of their choice.`,
