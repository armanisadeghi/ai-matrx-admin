# AI Matrx Research System

A structured, multi-stage research pipeline designed to take a topic from raw keywords all the way to a polished, human-edited document. The system is project-based, fully traceable, and built for AI-assisted analysis at every stage.

## Core Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Project** | The root container. Groups one or more related research topics together. |
| **Topic** | The fundamental unit of research. Everything in the system — keywords, sources, content, analysis — belongs to a topic. |
| **Keyword** | Search terms used to discover sources for a topic. |
| **Source** | A webpage or document discovered through keyword research. |
| **Content** | Scraped or extracted content from a source. |
| **Analysis** | AI-generated analysis of individual pages or content. |
| **Synthesis** | AI-generated cross-source analysis, grouped by keyword, tag, or manual selection. |
| **Document** | The final versioned output — human-edited, and the source of truth for the topic. |

---

## Research Pipeline

Topics flow through a structured, sequential pipeline:

**Keywords → Sources → Content → Analysis → Synthesis → Document**

### Example — Project: All Green Rebrand / Topic: All Green Brand Profile

| Stage | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Keywords** | `"All Green Electronics Recycling"`, `"All Green Los Angeles e-waste"` |
| **Sources** | 100–150 unique webpages discovered from keyword searches |
| **Content** | Scraped content from the 6–20 highest-value pages |
| **Analysis** | AI-generated analysis per page |
| **Synthesis** | AI cross-page analysis, grouped by keyword, tag, or manual selection |
| **Document** | Final polished output — human-edited source of truth for the topic |

### Example Topics Within a Project

| # | Name | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **All Green Brand Profile** | Current brand identity, positioning, messaging, and visual language — including tone, target audience, competitive differentiation, and marketing presence. |
| 2 | **All Green Services** | Full catalog of services: IT asset disposition, data destruction, e-waste recycling, and compliance/logistics offerings. Covers scope, process, and client-facing value. |
| 3 | **Federal Recycling & Data Security Laws** | Federal laws and regulations affecting All Green's corporate clients across healthcare, finance, and government — covering e-waste disposal, data destruction standards, and compliance requirements. |

## Schema Reference

> Single source of truth for the `rs_` table structure. Updated after the schema cleanup (Feb 2026).

## Architecture

```
projects (existing)
  └── rs_topic          ← only table with project_id
        ├── rs_keyword
        │     └── rs_keyword_source (join)
        ├── rs_source
        │     ├── rs_content
        │     ├── rs_media
        │     └── rs_source_tag (join)
        ├── rs_analysis
        ├── rs_synthesis   ← scope: keyword | project | tag | custom
        ├── rs_tag
        └── rs_document
```

All child tables reference `rs_topic` via `topic_id`. No child table carries `project_id` — RLS policies chain through `rs_topic.project_id → projects`.

## Tables

| Table | Purpose | Key FKs | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| **rs_topic** | A research topic within a project. Holds config, agent settings, autonomy level. | `project_id → projects` | "All Green Brand Profile" for the "All Green Rebrand" project |
| **rs_keyword** | Search terms for a topic. Tracks search provider, params, staleness. | `topic_id → rs_topic` | `"e-waste recycling regulations"` |
| **rs_source** | A discovered URL (web page, PDF, YouTube). Stores title, hostname, rank, scrape status. | `topic_id → rs_topic` | `https://epa.gov/e-waste` |
| **rs_keyword_source** | Join table linking keywords to sources with per-keyword rank. | `keyword_id → rs_keyword`, `source_id → rs_source` | keyword #1 found source #5 at rank 3 |
| **rs_content** | Versioned scraped text for a source. Tracks hash, char count, quality, capture method. | `source_id → rs_source`, `topic_id → rs_topic` | Version 2 of scraped HTML from epa.gov |
| **rs_media** | Images/videos extracted from a source during scraping. | `source_id → rs_source`, `topic_id → rs_topic` | An infographic from epa.gov |
| **rs_analysis** | Per-page LLM summary (Tier A). One per source+agent. Tracks status, error, tokens. | `source_id → rs_source`, `content_id → rs_content`, `topic_id → rs_topic` | GPT-4o summary of the EPA page |
| **rs_synthesis** | Unified LLM synthesis table. Scope determines what it consolidates. Versioned with `is_current`. | `topic_id → rs_topic`, `keyword_id → rs_keyword` (nullable), `tag_id → rs_tag` (nullable) | See scopes below |
| **rs_tag** | User-defined category labels for a topic (e.g., "Pricing", "Compliance"). | `topic_id → rs_topic` | Tag: "Federal Regulations" |
| **rs_source_tag** | Join table linking sources to tags. Includes confidence and assigned_by for auto-tagging. | `source_id → rs_source`, `tag_id → rs_tag` | Source #5 tagged "Federal Regulations" with 0.92 confidence |
| **rs_document** | Versioned final research document. `is_current` marks the latest version. | `topic_id → rs_topic` | "Research Report: All Green Brand Profile" v3 |
| **rs_template** | Reusable research templates with default keywords, tags, and agent config. | `created_by → auth.users` | "Company Profile" template |

## rs_synthesis Scopes

| Scope | `keyword_id` | `tag_id` | Purpose | Example |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|---------|
| `keyword` | set | null | Synthesis of all analyses for one keyword | Synthesis of all pages found via "e-waste recycling" |
| `project` | null | null | Full research report combining all keyword syntheses | Complete research report for the topic |
| `tag` | null | set | Consolidation of all sources tagged with a specific tag | All "Federal Regulations" content consolidated |
| `custom` | null | null | User-created or manually assembled synthesis | A hand-curated executive summary |

---

## Version Control

- **rs_content**: `version` (int) + `is_current` (bool). New scrape → old version set `is_current=false`, new row inserted.
- **rs_synthesis**: `version` (int) + `is_current` (bool) + `previous_synthesis_id`. Same pattern as content.
- **rs_document**: `version` (int) + `is_current` (bool). New generation marks all previous as not current.

---

## Status Tracking

Tables with LLM output (`rs_analysis`, `rs_synthesis`, `rs_document`) have:
- `status`: `'success'` or `'failed'`
- `error`: error message (null on success)

Failed rows are retained for debugging and retry. The pipeline skips sources with `status='success'` during re-runs (idempotency).

---

## RLS Policy Chain

All policies chain through the `projects` table:
- **Direct children of rs_topic**: `topic_id IN (SELECT id FROM rs_topic WHERE project_id IN (SELECT id FROM projects))`
- **Join tables**: Chain through their parent (e.g., `rs_source_tag` → `rs_source` → `rs_topic` → `projects`)
