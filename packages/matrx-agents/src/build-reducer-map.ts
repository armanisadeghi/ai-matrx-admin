/**
 * buildAgentsReducerMap() — returns the full set of reducers the package
 * owns, keyed exactly as the selectors expect.
 *
 * Consumers spread it into their own `combineReducers` call:
 *
 *   const rootReducer = combineReducers({
 *     ...buildAgentsReducerMap(),
 *     // host-app slices below
 *     user: userReducer,
 *     theme: themeReducer,
 *     // ...
 *   });
 *
 * The returned object is stable across calls (no new keys), so this is
 * safe to call once at module scope.
