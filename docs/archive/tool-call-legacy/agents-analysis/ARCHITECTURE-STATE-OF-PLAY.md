## 1. Terminology — The Three Data Formats

Data for a single conversation turn exists in **three formats** at different lifecycle stages. These are NOT three different kinds of data — they are the SAME data at different stages of processing.

### Format 1: Database Storage Format ("DB Format")

**What it is**: The raw serialized form stored in database tables. A single assistant message in `cx_message.content` is a JSONB array of typed dictionaries. Tool call data is stored separately in `cx_tool_call`. Media is stored in `cx_message.content` entries with `type: "media"`.

**Example** — a single `cx_message.content` array:
```json
[
  { "type": "thinking", "text": "", "metadata": {}, "provider": "google", "signature": "..." },
  { "type": "text", "text": "Hi there! I've put together..." },
  { "type": "thinking", "text": "**Assessing the Prompt**\n\nI've started by...", "metadata": {} },
  { "type": "thinking", "text": "\n\n**Generating the Flashcards**\n\nI'm now...", "metadata": {} },
  { "type": "thinking", "text": "", "metadata": {}, "provider": "google", "signature": "..." },
  { "type": "text", "text": "\n\nNow that you have...\n\n<flashcards>\n---\nFront: ...\n</flashcards>" }
]
```

**Key characteristics**:
- Ordered array preserving original emission sequence
- "Message Parts" — each entry is a DB-level part (text, thinking, tool_call, media)
- Text parts contain raw markdown including XML tags like `<flashcards>`, `<quiz>`, etc.
- Thinking parts with empty text are signature bookends (not renderable)
- Tool call references (type: "tool_call") point to `cx_tool_call` records by call_id
- **This is the "worst case" input** — requires the most processing to render

### Format 2: Stream Wire Format ("Stream Format")

**What it is**: The real-time NDJSON events from the Python backend. Each line is `{"event": "<type>", "data": {...}}`. During a stream, the equivalent of a single DB message arrives as a sequence of events over time.

**Key characteristics**:
- Events arrive in real-time order — the ordering IS the interleaving
- Text arrives as `chunk` events (many small fragments)
- Reasoning arrives as `reasoning_chunk` events
- Tool calls arrive as `tool_event` sub-events (started → progress → completed)
- Structured content arrives as `content_block` events with `status: "streaming" | "complete"`
- **When Python pre-parses**, it sends the parsed blocks as `content_block` events — identical to what `splitContentIntoBlocksV2` would produce client-side

### Format 3: Render Format ("Render Blocks")

**What it is**: The final, ready-to-render array of typed blocks that the component tree iterates over. This is what `BlockRenderer` consumes.

**THIS IS IDENTICAL whether Python parsed it or the client parsed it.** A flashcard block from Python and a flashcard block from `splitContentIntoBlocksV2` are the same shape. The only difference is who did the work.

**The render format is a flat, ordered array of blocks:**
```typescript
// Example render output for the message above:
[
  { type: "thinking", content: "**Assessing the Prompt**\n\n..." },
  { type: "thinking", content: "**Generating the Flashcards**\n\n..." },
  { type: "text", content: "Hi there! I've put together..." },
  { type: "text", content: "Now that you have the recommendations..." },
  { type: "flashcards", content: "Front: What language...\nBack: Spanish...", metadata: { isComplete: true } },
  { type: "tool_call", toolUpdates: [...] },  // if tools were used
]
```

After a block-type-specific secondary parser runs (e.g., `flashcard-parser.ts`), a flashcards block becomes:
```typescript
{ flashcards: [{ front: "...", back: "..." }, ...], isComplete: true, partialCard: null }
```

### The Processing Pipeline

```
FORMAT 1 (DB)  ──translate──→  FORMAT 2 equivalent  ──parse──→  FORMAT 3 (Render Blocks)
FORMAT 2 (Stream)  ──────────────────────────────────parse──→  FORMAT 3 (Render Blocks)
FORMAT 3 (from Python)  ─────────────────────────────────────→  FORMAT 3 (Render Blocks) ✓ direct
```

**Critical insight**: If Python sends us pre-parsed Format 3 blocks, we skip all parsing. If Python sends raw text (Format 2), we parse it client-side. If we load from DB (Format 1), we first reconstruct what would have streamed, then parse. But the output is ALWAYS the same Format 3.

### Streaming Completion Flags

When Python streams structured blocks (flashcards, quiz, timeline, etc.), each `content_block` event carries a `status` field:
- `status: "streaming"` — block is still being built, show loading/skeleton
- `status: "complete"` — block is finalized, render fully
- `status: "error"` — block parsing failed, show error fallback

This allows lazy updates during streaming and prevents unnecessary re-renders of incomplete blocks.

### What Belongs in Redux

For each conversation turn, Redux should store **all three formats** as they become available:

| Field | What | Required? | When populated |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dbContent` | Format 1 — raw DB arrays | Optional | On DB load, or when record_update events confirm persistence |
| `streamEvents` | Format 2 — raw stream events (or reconstructed equivalent) | Optional | During/after streaming, or synthesized from DB |
| `renderBlocks` | Format 3 — the parsed, ordered, ready-to-render blocks | **Required** | Always — this is the ONLY format the UI reads |

The renderer ONLY ever reads `renderBlocks`. The other two formats exist for debugging, re-processing, and as the "source of truth" for data integrity.

### Terminology Resolution

| Term | Meaning | NOT to be confused with |
|---|---|---|
| **Message Part** | A single entry in `cx_message.content[]` (DB Format 1) | Not a "block" — a message can have 6 parts that produce 15 render blocks |
| **Stream Event** | A single NDJSON line from the backend (Stream Format 2) | Not a "block" — multiple chunk events merge into one text render block |
| **Render Block** | A single renderable unit in the final ordered array (Format 3) | The ONLY format components consume |
| **Artifact Candidate** | A render block that represents structured content (flashcards, quiz, diagram, etc.) — may or may not become a saved Artifact | Subset of render blocks |
| **Content Block (legacy)** | `ContentBlock` interface in `content-splitter-v2.ts` — this IS a render block | Same thing, just the current TypeScript name |
| **ContentBlockPayload (legacy)** | Wire protocol shape from `stream-events.ts` — a partially-processed stream event | Must be converted to a render block before rendering |

---

## 2. The Canonical Protocol — What We Already Have (But Aren't Using)

**Critical discovery**: `lib/chat-protocol/` is a complete, well-documented, pure-TypeScript package that already implements the unified Format 3 architecture described above. It has converters from both DB and stream sources, immutable output, protocol versioning, and legacy adapters. **It is barely wired into the active Redux pipeline.**

### What `lib/chat-protocol/` contains

| File | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `types.ts` | `CanonicalMessage`, `CanonicalBlock` union (TextBlock, ThinkingBlock, MediaBlock, ToolCallBlock, ErrorBlock), `StreamingState` | Complete, well-typed |
| `from-stream.ts` | `buildCanonicalBlocks(events)` — converts `StreamEvent[]` → `CanonicalBlock[]` with correct interleaving | Complete |
| `from-db.ts` | `buildCanonicalMessages(dbMessages, toolCalls)` — converts `CxMessage[]` + `CxToolCall[]` → `CanonicalMessage[]` handling V1+V2 schemas, tool output patching, thinking/media/code blocks | Complete |
| `adapters.ts` | `canonicalToLegacy()` — bridges to old `ChatMessage` / `ToolCallObject[]` for existing renderers. Marked `@deprecated`. | Complete |
| `README.md` | Full architecture docs, usage examples, migration plan, tool state contract | Complete |

### The `CanonicalBlock` union — our Format 3

```typescript
type CanonicalBlock =
  | TextBlock        // { type: 'text', content: string }
  | ThinkingBlock    // { type: 'thinking', content: string }
  | MediaBlock       // { type: 'media', kind: 'image'|'audio'|'video'|'document'|'youtube', url: string }
  | ToolCallBlock    // { type: 'tool_call', callId, toolName, input, output?, error?, progress, phase }
  | ErrorBlock       // { type: 'error', errorType: string, message: string }
```

### What's missing from `CanonicalBlock` vs what we need

The `CanonicalBlock` union covers the "message-level" block types (text, thinking, media, tools, errors) but does NOT cover **artifact candidates** — the structured content blocks that `splitContentIntoBlocksV2` and Python both produce:

**Not in CanonicalBlock yet**: flashcards, quiz, presentation, cooking_recipe, timeline, progress_tracker, comparison_table, troubleshooting, resources, decision_tree, research, diagram, math_problem, code, table, transcript, tasks, structured_info, questionnaire, matrxBroker

These are currently handled by the `ContentBlock` type in `content-splitter-v2.ts` and by `BlockRenderer.tsx` — both of which sit in the rendering layer, not in the protocol layer.

### Why it's not connected

The active Redux pipeline (`processStream` → `activeRequests` → `commitAssistantTurn` → `instanceConversationHistory`) was built independently. It uses:
- `ContentBlockPayload` from `types/python-generated/stream-events.ts` (wire format)
- `normalizeContentBlocks` from `features/agents/redux/execution-system/utils/normalize-content-blocks.ts`
- Direct text accumulation (`textChunks.join("")`)

It does NOT use:
- `buildCanonicalBlocks()` from `lib/chat-protocol/from-stream.ts`
- `buildCanonicalMessages()` from `lib/chat-protocol/from-db.ts`
- `CanonicalMessage` or `CanonicalBlock` types anywhere in the Redux layer

### Who does import from `lib/chat-protocol/`

Only 5 files import from it — none of them are in the active pipeline:
- `StreamAwareChatMarkdown.tsx` — the event-driven rendering path (used by public chat only)
- `EnhancedChatMarkdown.tsx` — imports types but doesn't use the converters
- `ChatStreamDisplay.tsx` — a chat feature component
- `DEPRECATED-useAgentChat.ts` — deprecated hook
- `MessageDisplay.tsx` — public chat display
- `sendMessage.ts` — cx-conversation thunk (System B)

### The gap

We have **two parallel conversion systems**:
1. `lib/chat-protocol/` — correct design, handles text+thinking+media+tools, order-preserving, immutable, well-tested
2. `normalize-content-blocks.ts` + `processStream` + `commitAssistantTurn` — the active system, handles streaming but loses ordering and drops reasoning on commit

**Neither system handles the full Format 3 render block set** (artifact candidates like flashcards, quiz, etc.). That parsing currently only happens at render time in `EnhancedChatMarkdown` → `splitContentIntoBlocksV2`.

## 3. Redux Slice Inventory — Where Data Lives

### Active Slices That Store Messages

| # | Slice Name | Key | Stores | Used By |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`instanceConversationHistory`** | `conversationId` | `ConversationTurn[]` (text + contentBlocks) | SSR chat route, agent builder, agent runner, overlays |
| 2 | **`chatConversations`** | `sessionId` | `ConversationMessage[]` (text + rawContent + toolCalls + streaming) | Legacy `/a/` route, cx-conversation feature |
| 3 | **`activeRequests`** | `requestId` (indexed by `conversationId`) | Live streaming data: textChunks, reasoningChunks, contentBlocks, toolLifecycle, timeline | Used during active stream, read by AgentAssistantMessage |
| 4 | **`promptExecution`** | `runId` | `ConversationMessage[]` (structural clone of chatConversations) | Prompt apps runner (legacy) |

### Active Slices That Store Metadata Only (No Messages)

| # | Slice Name | Key | Stores |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | **`activeChat`** | `sessionId` ref | Active session pointer, selected agent, queued first message, model settings |
| 6 | **`cxConversations`** | `id` (DB UUID) | Sidebar list: title, updatedAt, messageCount (no messages) |
| 7 | **`agentConversations`** | `agentId::version` | Agent builder sidebar list (no messages) |
| 8 | **`conversationFocus`** | `surfaceKey` | Surface → conversationId mapping |
| 9 | **`instanceUIState`** | `conversationId` | Display config per instance |
| 10 | **`instanceUserInput`** | `conversationId` | User input draft per instance |

### Ephemeral / Domain-Specific Slices

| # | Slice Name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 11 | **`messageActions`** | Snapshot of message content for action overlays (Save to Notes, etc.) |
| 12 | **`agentAssistantMarkdownDraft`** | Draft edits of assistant messages |
| 13 | **`flashcardChat`** | Per-flashcard chat history (domain-specific) |

### Deprecated Slices (Still Registered in Root Reducer)

| # | Slice Name | Era | Replacement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 14 | `conversation` | Socket.IO v1 | `instanceConversationHistory` |
| 15 | `messages` | Socket.IO v1 | `instanceConversationHistory` |
| 16 | `newMessage` | Socket.IO v1 | `instanceUserInput` |
| 17 | `chatDisplay` | Socket.IO v1 | `instanceConversationHistory` |
| 18 | `aiChat` | Socket.IO v1 | `instanceConversationHistory` |

### React Context (Non-Redux)

| # | Context | Status | Replacement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 19 | `DEPRECATED-ChatContext` | Deprecated (filename says so) | `chatConversations` / `instanceConversationHistory` |

### The Overlap Problem

**`instanceConversationHistory` and `chatConversations` store the same data in different shapes for different UI surfaces.** They both represent a conversation with messages, both track role/content/status, both load from the same `cx_message` table, but they:

- Use different keys (`conversationId` vs `sessionId`)
- Use different message types (`ConversationTurn` vs `ConversationMessage`)
- Have different feature sets (chatConversations has inline streaming and tool calls; instanceConversationHistory delegates those to `activeRequests`)
- Have independent DB query paths (direct Supabase vs API route)

They do NOT dual-load the same conversation — each route/surface picks one system — but they represent **two competing architectures** that should be unified.

---

## 4. The Two Parallel Systems

### System A: Agent Execution System (the active, primary system)

**Route**: `/ssr/chat/c/[conversationId]`
**Orchestrator**: `ChatInstanceManager`
**Slices**: `instanceConversationHistory` + `activeRequests` + `instanceUIState` + `instanceUserInput` + `conversationFocus`
**DB Query**: Direct Supabase client → `cx_message` only
**Streaming**: HTTP NDJSON → `processStream` thunk → `activeRequests` → `commitAssistantTurn` → `instanceConversationHistory`
**Rendering**: `AgentConversationDisplay` → `AgentAssistantMessage` → `MarkdownStream` → `EnhancedChatMarkdown` → `BlockRenderer`

**This is the system we are actively building and should be the sole survivor.**

### System B: CX Conversation System (legacy, parallel)

**Route**: `/a/[agentId]/[conversationId]` (old layout)
**Orchestrator**: `useConversationSession`
**Slices**: `chatConversations` + `activeChat`
**DB Query**: `fetch('/api/cx-chat/request')` → server-side `loadFullConversation` (3 tables)
**Streaming**: Inline on `ConversationMessage` via `appendStreamChunk` / `pushStreamEvent`
**Rendering**: `ConversationShell` → various cx-conversation components

**This system should be deprecated and removed.**

### System C: Public Chat (deprecated, uses React Context)

**Route**: `/p/chat/c/[conversationId]`
**State**: `DEPRECATED-ChatContext` (useReducer)
**DB Query**: `useChatPersistence().loadConversation` → same API route as System B
**Rendering**: `ChatLayoutShell` → public chat components

**Already marked deprecated. Should be migrated to System A or a minimal variant.**

## 5. Data Flow: Streaming (Live)

```
User submits message
  ↓
dispatch(addUserTurn)                          → instanceConversationHistory.turns.push(userTurn)
  ↓
dispatch(executeInstance / processStream)
  ↓
HTTP POST → Python backend → NDJSON response stream
  ↓
parseNdjsonStream (read-ahead queue)           → AsyncGenerator<StreamEvent>
  ↓

  ├─ data (typed)         → appendDataPayload      → activeRequests.dataPayloads.push(data)
  │                         upsertContentBlock      → promoted to contentBlocks (non-metadata types)
  ├─ tool_event           → upsertToolLifecycle     → activeRequests.toolLifecycle[callId] = lifecycle
  ├─ phase                → setCurrentPhase         → activeRequests.currentPhase
  ├─ init                 → trackOperationInit      → (metadata tracking)
  ├─ completion           → trackOperationCompletion → tokenUsage, finishReason, completionStats
  ├─ record_reserved      → upsertReservation       → activeRequests.reservations[table::id]
  │                         setConversationId       → (if cx_conversation row reserved)
  ├─ record_update        → upsertReservation       → status update
  ├─ warning              → addWarning              → activeRequests.warnings.push(warning)
  ├─ info                 → addInfoEvent            → activeRequests.infoEvents.push(info)
  ├─ error                → setRequestStatus(error) → breaks loop
  ├─ end                  → setRequestStatus(complete)
  ├─ broker               → appendDataPayload       → activeRequests.dataPayloads.push(broker)
  ├─ heartbeat            → (timeline only)
  └─ ALL events           → appendRawEvent          → activeRequests.rawEvents.push(event)
                            appendTimeline          → activeRequests.timeline.push(entry)
```

**During streaming, the UI reads directly from `activeRequests`:**
- `selectAccumulatedText(requestId)` → joins `textChunks` on each render
- `selectAllContentBlocks(requestId)` → maps `contentBlockOrder` to `contentBlocks`
- `selectStreamPhase(conversationId)` → from `activeRequests`

---

## 6. Data Flow: Commit (Stream End)

```
Stream loop ends (end event or error)
  ↓
dispatch(finalizeAccumulatedText)     → joins textChunks into accumulatedText
dispatch(finalizeAccumulatedReasoning) → joins reasoningChunks into accumulatedReasoning
  ↓
Read final state:
  completedText = activeRequests.accumulatedText
  finalContentBlocks = contentBlockOrder.map(id → contentBlocks[id])
  tokenUsage, finishReason, completionStats from completion event
  ↓
dispatch(commitAssistantTurn({
  conversationId,
  requestId,
  content: completedText,              ← flat text string
  contentBlocks: finalContentBlocks,    ← ContentBlockPayload[] (audio, search, flashcards, etc.)
  tokenUsage,
  finishReason,
  completionStats,
}))
  ↓
instanceConversationHistory.turns.push({
  turnId: uuid(),
  role: "assistant",
  content: completedText,               ← JUST the LLM text output
  contentBlocks: finalContentBlocks,     ← everything else (thinking NOT included here — see §8)
  timestamp, requestId, conversationId, ...
})
```

---

## 7. Data Flow: DB Load (History)

```
User navigates to /ssr/chat/c/[conversationId]
  ↓
Server Component renders <ChatInstanceManager conversationId={id}>
  ↓
ChatInstanceManager.useEffect:
  1. dispatch(createManualInstance)     → sets up instanceConversationHistory entry
  2. dispatch(fetchConversationHistory) → Supabase query
  ↓
fetchConversationHistory thunk:
  ↓
  Supabase.from("cx_message")
    .select(explicit columns)
    .eq("conversation_id", id)
    .is("deleted_at", null)
    .order("position", { ascending: true })
  ↓
  For each row (user or assistant):
    rawBlocks = row.content (JSONB array)    ← these are DbContentEntry[]
    textBlock = rawBlocks.find(type === "text")
    primaryText = textBlock.text             ← extracted as the "content" string
    richBlocks = rawBlocks.filter(type !== "text")
    normalizedBlocks = normalizeContentBlocks(richBlocks)  ← DbContentEntry[] → ContentBlockPayload[]
    ↓
    ConversationTurn = {
      content: primaryText,                  ← flat text
      contentBlocks: normalizedBlocks,       ← everything except the text block
    }
  ↓
dispatch(loadConversationHistory({ conversationId, turns }))
  ↓
instanceConversationHistory.byConversationId[id].turns = turns
instanceConversationHistory.byConversationId[id].loadedFromHistory = true
```

**Critical detail**: The DB stores ALL content as an array of typed blocks in `cx_message.content`. The `fetchConversationHistory` thunk separates the `text` block from everything else, putting the text string in `turn.content` and the rest in `turn.contentBlocks`. This is the same split that `commitAssistantTurn` produces — text goes to `content`, rich blocks go to `contentBlocks`.

---

## 8. Rendering Pipeline

    └─ ELSE (text-only, no server blocks):
        return splitContentIntoBlocksV2(content)                          ← client-side parsing only
  ↓

  │
  ├─ "text","info","task",etc.  → BasicMarkdownContent (render markdown)
  ├─ "code"                     → CodeBlock (syntax highlighting)
  ├─ "thinking","reasoning"     → ThinkingVisualization / ReasoningVisualization
  ├─ "flashcards","quiz",etc.   → Dual-path: serverData → structured component, else client parse
  ├─ "audio_output"             → AudioOutputBlock (from serverData.url)
  ├─ "search_results"           → SearchResultsBlock (from serverData)
  ├─ "unknown_data_event"       → UnknownDataEventBlock
  └─ default                    → BasicMarkdownContent fallback
```

### For Streaming Turns (during active stream)

Same component tree, but:
- `turnId` is null, `requestId` is set, `isStreamActive` is true
- `content` comes from `selectAccumulatedText(requestId)` (live textChunks.join)
- `serverProcessedBlocks` comes from `selectAllContentBlocks(requestId)` (live contentBlocks)
- Reasoning consolidation is skipped
- `BlockRenderer` receives `isStreamActive=true` for animation hints

---

## 9. The Order-Loss Problem

This is the most significant data integrity issue in the current system.

### What the server sends (in order):
```
1. reasoning_chunk "Let me think..."
2. reasoning_chunk "I should consider..."
3. chunk "Here is my answer"
4. chunk " to your question."
5. content_block { type: "flashcards", data: {...} }
6. chunk " And here's more text after the flashcards."
7. content_block { type: "audio_output", data: {...} }
```

### What we store (after commit):
```
turn.content = "Here is my answer to your question. And here's more text after the flashcards."
turn.contentBlocks = [
  { type: "flashcards", data: {...} },
  { type: "audio_output", data: {...} }
]
```

### What we render:
```
[text block] "Here is my answer to your question. And here's more text after the flashcards."
[flashcards block]
[audio block]
```

### The problem:

**Interleaving is destroyed.** The original sequence was: reasoning → text → flashcards → more text → audio. But after commit, all text is concatenated into a single string and all blocks are appended at the end. The flashcards should appear between two paragraphs of text, but instead they appear after all the text.

**Reasoning is lost entirely on commit.** The `commitAssistantTurn` action stores `accumulatedText` (only chunk events) in `content`. The `accumulatedReasoning` (reasoning_chunk events) is finalized but never stored on the committed turn. It only persists in the `activeRequests` slice, which is ephemeral.

**DB-loaded messages have the same problem.** The `fetchConversationHistory` thunk extracts the `text` block from `cx_message.content` and puts it in `turn.content`, then puts everything else in `turn.contentBlocks`. Even though the DB preserves ordering in its JSONB array, we flatten it.

### Root cause:

The `ConversationTurn` type uses `content: string` (a single flat text field) plus `contentBlocks: ContentBlockPayload[]` (a separate array). This two-field design inherently cannot represent interleaved content. You cannot express "text, then flashcards, then more text" — only "all text" and "all blocks."

## 10. Deprecated / Dead Code

The following should be removed:

### Socket.IO System (dead)
- `lib/redux/socket-io/` — 32 files, completely disabled. `establishConnection` returns `null`. The Python server no longer supports Socket.IO.

### Deprecated Redux Slices
- `lib/redux/features/aiChats/conversationSlice.ts` — old global conversation metadata
- `lib/redux/features/aiChats/messagesSlice.ts` — old normalized messages
- `lib/redux/features/aiChats/newMessageSlice.ts` — old single message draft
- `lib/redux/features/aiChats/chatDisplaySlice.ts` — old streaming display
- `lib/redux/slices/aiChatSlice.ts` — old multi-chat state

### Deprecated Context
- `features/public-chat/context/DEPRECATED-ChatContext.tsx` — React Context chat state

### CX Conversation System (System B)
- `features/cx-conversation/redux/` — the parallel `chatConversations` slice
- `features/cx-conversation/redux/thunks/` — independent DB loading path

### Prompt Execution System
- `lib/redux/prompt-execution/` — structural clone of chatConversations, replaced

### Chat Protocol Adapters
- `lib/chat-protocol/adapters.ts` — `canonicalToLegacy` conversion layer, no longer needed if we unify on the streaming protocol types

---

## 11. Streaming Protocol Reference

### Transport
HTTP POST → NDJSON response (`\n`-delimited JSON lines). Read-ahead queue parser prevents backpressure drops.

### Headers
- `X-Request-ID` — unique per API call
- `X-Conversation-ID` — server-assigned conversation UUID

### Event Envelope
```json
{ "event": "<type>", "data": { ...payload } }
```

### 16 Event Types
| Event | Purpose | Key Payload Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `chunk` | LLM text token | `text` |
| `reasoning_chunk` | LLM reasoning token | `text` |
| `phase` | Stream lifecycle phase | `phase` (12 values) |
| `init` | Operation lifecycle start | `operation`, `operation_id` |
| `completion` | Operation lifecycle end | `operation`, `status`, `result` (token usage, stats) |
| `content_block` | Structured content | `blockId`, `blockIndex`, `type`, `status`, `content?`, `data?` |
| `data` | Typed data payload (16 sub-types) | `type` discriminator + per-type fields |
| `tool_event` | Tool lifecycle (7 sub-types) | `event`, `call_id`, `tool_name`, `data?` |
| `record_reserved` | DB row pre-created | `table`, `record_id`, `parent_refs?` |
| `record_update` | DB row status change | `table`, `record_id`, `status` |
| `warning` | Non-fatal warning | `code`, `system_message`, `user_message?` |
| `info` | Progress FYI | `code`, `system_message` |
| `error` | Fatal error | `error_type`, `message`, `user_message?` |
| `broker` | Broker value update | `broker_id`, `value` |
| `heartbeat` | Keep-alive | `timestamp?` |
| `end` | Stream termination | `reason?` |

### Typical Event Order
1. `phase(connected)` → `data(conversation_id)` → `record_reserved` (DB rows)
2. `phase(processing)` → `init(user_request)` → optional `warning`/`info`
3. `reasoning_chunk`* → `chunk`* (interleaved with `content_block` and `tool_event`)
4. `data(conversation_labeled)` → `record_update` → `completion(user_request)`
5. `end`

### Server Capability Reminder
**We control both client and server.** The Python backend can be modified to:
- Promote sub-events to top-level events with new names
- Add new event types
- Change event payload shapes
- Add ordering/sequencing metadata to events
- Send richer completion payloads

---

## 12. Strengths of the Current System

1. **Well-defined streaming protocol.** The 16-event NDJSON protocol is clean, well-typed (auto-generated from Pydantic), and well-documented. Every event type has a TypeScript interface and type guard.

2. **Read-ahead stream parser.** The `parseNdjsonStream` decouples network reads from React processing, preventing backpressure drops with large payloads.

3. **Comprehensive event routing.** `processStream` handles all 16 event types with no gaps. Every event hits `appendRawEvent` and `appendTimeline` for full debug visibility.

4. **Rich block renderer.** `BlockRenderer` handles 40+ block types with lazy-loaded components, loading states, and a dual-path (serverData vs. client-parse) fallback strategy.

5. **Normalizer exists.** `normalizeContentBlocks` already bridges the gap between DB shapes and stream protocol shapes, handling legacy media types, text-field blocks, and user-input types.

6. **Unified streaming + committed rendering.** `AgentAssistantMessage` uses the same component tree for both live and committed messages — just different data sources.

7. **Record reservation system.** The server pre-creates DB rows and streams back their IDs, so the client has real DB IDs for conversations, requests, and messages before the stream ends.

---

## 13. Weaknesses and Design Debts

### Critical

1. **Order loss on commit.** Text is concatenated into a flat string and blocks are appended at the end, destroying interleaved content ordering. (See §8.)

2. **Reasoning lost on commit.** `accumulatedReasoning` is never stored on the committed turn. Reasoning blocks only exist in `activeRequests` (ephemeral).

3. **Two competing architectures.** `instanceConversationHistory` (System A) and `chatConversations` (System B) are parallel implementations of the same concept. Both actively used by different routes.

4. **Text/blocks split destroys DB ordering.** `fetchConversationHistory` separates the `text` block from the content array, even though the DB array preserves the original emission order.

### Significant

5. **Terminology collision.** Three different things called "block" — protocol blocks, render segments, and DB content entries. This confuses every developer and AI agent working on the system.

6. **No shared conversation loading service.** System A queries Supabase directly (client-side, messages only). System B goes through an API route (server-side, 3 tables). Same data, different paths, different transforms.

7. **BlockRenderingContext in rendering tree.** A React Context (`BlockRenderingContext`) was added inside the rendering pipeline with `strictServerData`. This is a debug toggle that should be a dev-tools flag, not a context provider in the render tree.

8. **Deprecated slices still registered.** Five deprecated slices from the Socket.IO era are still in the root reducer, increasing bundle size and confusion.

9. **Socket.IO dead code.** 32 files, `establishConnection` returns null. Complete dead weight.

### Minor

10. **`chatConversations` mixes streaming and storage.** It has inline `appendStreamChunk` / `pushStreamEvent` actions alongside persistent `messages[]`. System A correctly separates these concerns (`activeRequests` for streaming, `instanceConversationHistory` for persistence).

11. **`promptExecution` is a structural clone** of `chatConversations`. Likely no longer needed.

12. **`DEPRECATED-ChatContext`** still exists and may still be imported by public chat routes.

## 14. Gap Analysis — What's Missing

This section maps every piece that exists, every piece that's missing, and the exact work needed to connect them into a single pipeline.

### What EXISTS and is CORRECT

| Component | Location | What It Does | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stream protocol types | `types/python-generated/stream-events.ts` | 16 event types, TypedStreamEvent union, type guards | Production, auto-generated |
| NDJSON parser | `lib/api/stream-parser.ts` | Read-ahead queue, backpressure-safe | Production |
| Event routing | `features/agents/redux/execution-system/thunks/process-stream.ts` | Routes all 16 event types | Production |
| Canonical protocol types | `lib/chat-protocol/types.ts` | CanonicalMessage, CanonicalBlock union | Complete, unused by active pipeline |
| Stream → Canonical | `lib/chat-protocol/from-stream.ts` | buildCanonicalBlocks() with correct interleaving | Complete, unused by active pipeline |
| DB → Canonical | `lib/chat-protocol/from-db.ts` | buildCanonicalMessages() with V1/V2 support | Complete, unused by active pipeline |
| Legacy adapters | `lib/chat-protocol/adapters.ts` | canonicalToLegacy() bridge | Complete, used by 2-3 consumers |
| Block renderer | `BlockRenderer.tsx` | 40+ block types with dual-path (serverData vs client-parse) | Production |
| Block component registry | `BlockComponentRegistry.tsx` | Lazy-loaded components for all block types | Production |
| Content splitter | `content-splitter-v2.ts` | Markdown → render blocks (text, flashcards, code, etc.) | Production |
| DB normalizer | `normalize-content-blocks.ts` | DbContentEntry → ContentBlockPayload | Production |
| Tool call builder | `ToolRendererPreview.tsx` / `buildToolCallObjects()` | Stream events → ToolCallObject[] | Exists in demo code, not extracted |
| Fold stream events | `fold-stream-events.ts` | Complete event-to-bucket fold with tool mapping | Exists in demo code, not extracted |
| Tool renderer registry | `lib/tool-renderers/registry.tsx` | Static + dynamic tool renderers | Production |

### What's MISSING

#### Gap 1: CanonicalBlock doesn't include artifact candidates

`CanonicalBlock` = TextBlock | ThinkingBlock | MediaBlock | ToolCallBlock | ErrorBlock

But render blocks include 30+ artifact types (flashcards, quiz, timeline, etc.). These are currently only handled at the renderer level by `splitContentIntoBlocksV2` and `BlockRenderer`.

**Fix**: Two approaches:
- **Option A**: Add an `ArtifactBlock` variant to `CanonicalBlock` with `artifactType: string` + `content: string` + `data?: unknown` + `metadata?: unknown`. The content splitter produces these, Python produces these, and BlockRenderer reads `artifactType` to dispatch.
- **Option B**: Keep artifact parsing in the renderer and extend `TextBlock.content` to carry the unparsed markdown. The renderer calls `splitContentIntoBlocksV2` at render time.

**Recommendation**: Option A is cleaner — it means Format 3 is truly complete before it reaches the renderer. But it requires the Python team to send pre-parsed artifact blocks (which they already do via `content_block` events). For client-side parsing of raw markdown, `splitContentIntoBlocksV2` would produce `ArtifactBlock` entries instead of/alongside `TextBlock` entries.

#### Gap 2: processStream doesn't produce CanonicalBlocks

The active streaming pipeline accumulates text into `textChunks[]`, reasoning into `reasoningChunks[]`, and content blocks into `contentBlocks{}` — all separately. It never calls `buildCanonicalBlocks()`.

**Fix**: Replace the manual accumulation in `processStream` with calls to `buildCanonicalBlocks()` (extended to handle artifact blocks). Or: keep `processStream` as-is for real-time state (it works well for that), but at commit time, use the canonical protocol to build the final ordered array.

#### Gap 3: commitAssistantTurn loses ordering and drops reasoning

`commitAssistantTurn` stores `content: string` (concatenated text) and `contentBlocks: ContentBlockPayload[]` (appended at end). Reasoning never reaches the committed turn.

**Fix**: `commitAssistantTurn` should store `renderBlocks: CanonicalBlock[]` (or extended equivalent) built from the full timeline, replacing the split `content` + `contentBlocks` fields.

#### Gap 4: fetchConversationHistory doesn't use from-db.ts

The DB loading path in `features/cx-chat/redux/thunks.ts` manually extracts the text block and normalizes rich blocks. It does NOT call `buildCanonicalMessages()` from `lib/chat-protocol/from-db.ts` — which already handles all block types, V1/V2 schemas, tool output patching, and produces ordered CanonicalBlocks.

**Fix**: Replace the manual DB processing with `buildCanonicalMessages()`. This also means fetching `cx_tool_call` records alongside `cx_message` records (which the API route path in System B already does, but the direct Supabase path in System A does not).

#### Gap 5: ConversationTurn type doesn't support Format 3

`ConversationTurn` has `content: string` + `contentBlocks?: ContentBlockPayload[]`. It needs a `renderBlocks: CanonicalBlock[]` field (or extended variant) that the renderer reads directly.

**Fix**: Add `renderBlocks` to `ConversationTurn`. Mark `content` and `contentBlocks` as deprecated. The renderer reads `renderBlocks` first; if absent, falls back to the legacy fields.

#### Gap 6: buildToolCallObjects is stuck in demo code

The function that converts stream tool events into the `ToolCallObject[]` format needed by `ToolCallVisualization` exists only in `app/(public)/demos/api-tests/tool-testing/components/ToolRendererPreview.tsx`. It should be a shared utility.

**Fix**: Extract to `lib/tool-renderers/build-tool-call-objects.ts`. The function body is complete and correct — just needs to be moved.

#### Gap 7: No streaming completion flag propagation

When Python streams a content_block with `status: "streaming"`, the client can show a skeleton. But the current `upsertContentBlock` action only stores the full `ContentBlockPayload` — it doesn't propagate the `status` field to the rendering layer in a way that the renderer can use to show a loading state vs. final render.

**Fix**: The render block type should carry `isComplete: boolean` (or `status: "streaming" | "complete" | "error"`). BlockRenderer should check this before doing expensive secondary parsing (e.g., don't run the flashcard parser on an incomplete flashcard block).

#### Gap 8: EnhancedChatMarkdown does the merge wrong

`EnhancedChatMarkdown` concatenates: `[...textBlocks, ...supplementaryBlocks]` — text first, server blocks after. This destroys interleaving.

**Fix**: If we have Format 3 render blocks, `EnhancedChatMarkdown` doesn't need to merge anything. It receives an ordered array and iterates. The merge logic should be removed entirely.

#### Gap 9: Server-side pre-parsing not fully leveraged

Python already has the capability to send pre-parsed blocks via `content_block` events. But the current system treats these as "supplementary" rather than as the primary render source. When Python sends `content_block` events for flashcards, quiz, etc., they should be the authoritative Format 3 output — no client-side re-parsing needed.

**Fix**: When a `content_block` event arrives with a known artifact type and `status: "complete"`, it should be stored directly as a render block. Only fall back to client-side `splitContentIntoBlocksV2` when Python sends raw text without pre-parsing.

#### Gap 10: Two DB query paths for the same data

System A (SSR chat) queries `cx_message` only via direct Supabase client. System B (cx-conversation) queries `cx_conversation` + `cx_message` + `cx_tool_call` via API route. Neither uses `buildCanonicalMessages()`.

**Fix**: Create one shared conversation loading service that:
1. Queries `cx_message` + `cx_tool_call` (at minimum)
2. Calls `buildCanonicalMessages()` from `lib/chat-protocol/from-db.ts`
3. Returns `CanonicalMessage[]`
4. Both systems import from this service

### Summary: The Bridge

The architecture we need already exists in `lib/chat-protocol/`. The work is:
1. **Extend** CanonicalBlock to include artifact candidates
2. **Wire** the active pipeline to use it (processStream commit, DB load, ConversationTurn type)
3. **Remove** the parallel conversion systems (normalize-content-blocks.ts, manual text extraction in thunks)
4. **Simplify** the renderer to just iterate render blocks (no merge logic)

---

## 15. Recommended Architecture

### One System, One Slice, Three Formats Per Turn

```
instanceConversationHistory (the sole conversation slice)
  ├── byConversationId: Record<string, ConversationEntry>
  │   └── turns: ConversationTurn[]
  │       ├── renderBlocks: RenderBlock[]     ← REQUIRED, ordered, what the UI reads
  │       ├── dbContent?: DbMessagePart[]     ← Optional, raw DB format for debugging/re-processing
  │       └── streamEvents?: StreamEvent[]    ← Optional, raw stream events for debugging/replay
  │
  └── Every component reads ONLY renderBlocks — never the other two
```

### Extending CanonicalBlock into the Full Render Block

The existing `CanonicalBlock` union in `lib/chat-protocol/types.ts` needs one new variant to cover artifact candidates:

```typescript
// New block type to add to the CanonicalBlock union:
interface ArtifactBlock {
  readonly type: 'artifact';
  readonly artifactType: string;   // "flashcards", "quiz", "timeline", "code", "table", etc.
  readonly content: string;         // raw content (markdown/XML text that secondary parsers consume)
  readonly data?: unknown;          // pre-parsed structured data (if Python parsed it)
  readonly metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
  readonly isComplete: boolean;     // false while streaming, true when finalized
}

// Extended union:
type RenderBlock =
  | TextBlock           // { type: 'text', content: string }
  | ThinkingBlock       // { type: 'thinking', content: string }
  | MediaBlock          // { type: 'media', kind, url, ... }
  | ToolCallBlock       // { type: 'tool_call', callId, toolName, input, output?, phase, ... }
  | ArtifactBlock       // { type: 'artifact', artifactType, content, data?, isComplete }
  | ErrorBlock          // { type: 'error', errorType, message }
```

**Key design decisions:**
- `ArtifactBlock.artifactType` holds the specific type ("flashcards", "quiz", "code", etc.)
- `ArtifactBlock.data` holds pre-parsed structured data when Python did the parsing — BlockRenderer can use this directly without calling the secondary parser
- `ArtifactBlock.isComplete` tells the renderer whether to show a skeleton or the final component
- `TextBlock` remains for plain markdown text that doesn't contain artifact tags
- When `splitContentIntoBlocksV2` finds `<flashcards>` tags in a text string, it produces `ArtifactBlock` entries (not `TextBlock`)

### Server-Side Enhancements

**Sequence indices**: The Python backend should send an explicit `seq` on chunk and content_block events:

```json
{ "event": "chunk", "data": { "text": "Hello", "seq": 0 } }
{ "event": "content_block", "data": { "blockId": "...", "seq": 1, "type": "flashcards", "status": "streaming" } }
{ "event": "chunk", "data": { "text": " world", "seq": 2 } }
{ "event": "content_block", "data": { "blockId": "...", "seq": 1, "type": "flashcards", "status": "complete", "data": {...} } }
```

**Pre-parsed blocks**: When Python parses content (flashcards, quiz, etc.), it sends `content_block` events with `data` populated. The client stores these directly as `ArtifactBlock` entries with `data` set — no client-side re-parsing needed.

**Completion flag**: `status: "streaming" | "complete" | "error"` on every `content_block` event maps directly to `ArtifactBlock.isComplete`. The renderer shows a skeleton for `isComplete: false` and the full component for `isComplete: true`.

### DB Loading (using existing `lib/chat-protocol/from-db.ts`)

`buildCanonicalMessages()` already handles text, thinking, media, tool_call, code_exec, code_result, and web_search blocks. Extend it to:
1. Run `splitContentIntoBlocksV2` on `TextBlock.content` to extract embedded artifact tags
2. Produce `ArtifactBlock` entries for detected structured content
3. Return `RenderBlock[]` (extended CanonicalBlock) that can be stored directly on the turn

Alternatively, keep the text parsing at the renderer level (simpler change, same result).

### Streaming Accumulation

During streaming, `buildCanonicalBlocks()` from `lib/chat-protocol/from-stream.ts` (extended) runs on every event batch:

- `chunk` events → append to / create TextBlock (consecutive chunks merge)
- `reasoning_chunk` events → append to / create ThinkingBlock
- `content_block` events → create / update ArtifactBlock (with isComplete from status)
- `tool_event` events → create / update ToolCallBlock (with phase from sub-event)

On commit, the `RenderBlock[]` array is copied directly to the turn. **No lossy text concatenation. No separate contentBlocks field. No reasoning loss.**

### Rendering

`EnhancedChatMarkdown` receives `renderBlocks: RenderBlock[]` — a single ordered array. It iterates in order:
- `TextBlock` → call `splitContentIntoBlocksV2(block.content)` to detect embedded artifacts, then render each sub-block
- `ThinkingBlock` → render reasoning visualization
- `ArtifactBlock` → if `block.data` exists, pass structured data directly to the block component; else pass `block.content` for client-side secondary parsing
- `ToolCallBlock` → render tool call visualization
- `MediaBlock` → render audio/image/video
- `ErrorBlock` → render error display

**No merge. No concatenation. No `[...textBlocks, ...supplementaryBlocks]`. Just iterate.**

## 16. Migration Plan

### Phase 0: Dead Code Removal (unblocks everything)
1. Delete `lib/redux/socket-io/` (32 files) — connection returns null, complete dead code
2. Remove deprecated slices from root reducer: `conversation`, `messages`, `newMessage`, `chatDisplay`, `aiChat`
3. Delete `features/public-chat/context/DEPRECATED-ChatContext.tsx`
4. Audit `promptExecution` — if no active consumers, remove
5. **This is safe and immediate** — none of this code is reachable

### Phase 1: Extend the Canonical Protocol
1. Add `ArtifactBlock` to the `CanonicalBlock` union in `lib/chat-protocol/types.ts`
2. Update `buildCanonicalBlocks()` in `from-stream.ts` to handle `content_block` events → `ArtifactBlock`
3. Update `buildCanonicalMessages()` in `from-db.ts` to handle embedded artifact tags in text blocks (call `splitContentIntoBlocksV2` or just preserve text for renderer-level parsing)
4. Add `isComplete` / streaming status support to `ArtifactBlock`
5. Extract `buildToolCallObjects()` from `ToolRendererPreview.tsx` → `lib/tool-renderers/build-tool-call-objects.ts`
6. Update type guards and barrel exports

### Phase 2: Wire the Active Pipeline
1. Add `renderBlocks: RenderBlock[]` to `ConversationTurn` type (keep `content` + `contentBlocks` temporarily)
2. Update `commitAssistantTurn` to build `renderBlocks` using `buildCanonicalBlocks()` from the active request timeline — this replaces the lossy `content + contentBlocks` split
3. Update `fetchConversationHistory` to use `buildCanonicalMessages()` from `lib/chat-protocol/from-db.ts` — also fetch `cx_tool_call` records
4. Update `addUserTurn` to produce `renderBlocks` for user messages
5. Update `loadConversationHistory` reducer to accept `CanonicalMessage[]` and map to `ConversationTurn[]` with `renderBlocks`
6. Delete `normalize-content-blocks.ts` — no longer needed

### Phase 3: Simplify the Renderer
1. Update `AgentAssistantMessage` to pass `turn.renderBlocks` directly instead of `content + serverProcessedBlocks`
2. Update `EnhancedChatMarkdown` to accept `renderBlocks: RenderBlock[]` as primary input
3. Remove the `useMemo` merge logic (`[...textBlocks, ...supplementaryBlocks]`)
4. For `TextBlock` entries, still call `splitContentIntoBlocksV2` to detect embedded artifacts (unless Python already parsed them)
5. For `ArtifactBlock` entries with `data`, pass structured data directly to the block component
6. For `ToolCallBlock` entries, convert to `ToolCallObject[]` via the extracted builder and pass to `ToolCallVisualization`
7. Remove `BlockRenderingContext` / `strictServerData` — move to dev tools

### Phase 4: Deprecate System B
1. Migrate remaining `/a/` routes to use System A components and `instanceConversationHistory`
2. Remove `chatConversations` slice and `features/cx-conversation/redux/`
3. Create one shared conversation loading service backed by `buildCanonicalMessages()`
4. Both SSR chat and any future public chat use this single service

### Phase 5: Server-Side Enhancements
1. Add `seq` field to chunk, reasoning_chunk, and content_block events for ordering insurance
2. Ensure `content_block` events carry `status: "streaming" | "complete"` consistently
3. When Python pre-parses artifact content (flashcards, quiz, etc.), send the structured `data` field on the content_block event so client can skip secondary parsing
4. Ensure `cx_message.content` array preserves strict emission ordering
5. Consider merging `reasoning_chunk` into `chunk` with a `chunk_type` discriminator (simplifies the canonical protocol)

### Phase 6: Cleanup
1. Remove deprecated `content` and `contentBlocks` fields from `ConversationTurn`
2. Remove `adapters.ts` from `lib/chat-protocol/` (legacy bridge no longer needed)
3. Remove duplicate conversion paths (cx-content-converter.ts, tool-event-engine.ts, etc.)
4. Update all documentation to reflect the single-pipeline architecture
