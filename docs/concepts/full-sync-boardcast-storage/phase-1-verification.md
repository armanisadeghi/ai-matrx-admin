## 2. Success criteria — status per criterion

Criteria numbering matches the plan doc (`plans/here-are-the-responses-toasty-parrot.md` §"Success criteria").

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Theme persists across reloads with zero FOUC | 🟡 **Needs manual browser run** — see §3 checklist | `SyncBootScript` + `boot-critical` write-through path verified in `engine.middleware.test.ts` ("writes through synchronously for boot-critical slices") |
| 2 | Cross-tab sync <20ms | 🟡 **Needs manual browser run** — see §3 checklist | `engine.middleware.test.ts` covers the broadcast path; channel latency is `postMessage` bound (sub-ms in practice) |
| 3 | Peer hydration without localStorage read | ⏸️ **Deferred** — `HYDRATE_REQUEST` / `HYDRATE_RESPONSE` scaffolding is in `attachChannelListener` but inactive. Phase 1.C adds no peer hydration need; Phase 2 wires it for userPreferences. Flag, don't block. | `lib/sync/engine/boot.ts` §180–184 |
| 4 | Graceful degradation: localStorage disabled → default state, no crash | ✅ | `persistence.local.test.ts` covers read/write try/catch; also `persistence.local.test.ts` "survives JSON.parse failure" |
| 5 | Identity isolation — runtime identity swap | ✅ (API exposed) | `store._sync.setIdentity(next)` is wired; channel gates by `identityKey`. `engine.middleware.test.ts` verifies `identityKey` lands in persisted envelope. The reactive Supabase-auth hookup is Phase 4 per ground-truth #13. |
| 6 | Manifest items 1–3 deleted | ✅ | `features/shell/components/ThemeScript.tsx` deleted. `lib/redux/middleware/preferencesMiddleware.ts` deleted. Inline theme script removed from `app/layout.tsx`. Hardcoded `className="dark"` removed from `<html>`. |
| 7 | Unit tests green under jsdom | ✅ | `pnpm jest lib/sync/` → 14 suites / 92 tests passing (post-1.C). `jest.config.ts` created (superseding the misnamed `jest.config.js.ts`). |
| 8 | Demo route works | ✅ (route created, needs browser walk) | `app/(a)/sync-demo/theme/page.tsx` + `_client.tsx` |
| 9 | Legacy `'theme'` localStorage key migrated to `'matrx:theme'` | ✅ | `LEGACY_MIGRATIONS` in `engine/boot.ts`; `engine.boot.test.ts` "legacy key migration" case |
| 10 | `grep -r "useTheme\|ThemeProvider\|ThemeScript\|preferencesMiddleware"` → 0 | ✅ **Live-code: 0** — Post-1.D: `grep -rn "from ['\"]@/hooks/useTheme['\"]\|from ['\"]@/styles/themes/ThemeProvider['\"]"` across `app/ components/ features/ hooks/ lib/ styles/ providers/` returns **0 hits**. Remaining `useTheme` substring matches are (a) a local `useThemeMode` helper in `components/ui/sonner.tsx` (prefix collision only), (b) `components/admin/ReduxDebugInterface.tsx` imports from `next-themes` (different package). | Grep pasted inline. Shim files deleted (`2dd04c8b`). |
| 11 | Net-lines report | ✅ | See §4 below |

## 3. Manual browser checklist (for criteria 1, 2, 8)

Run against `http://localhost:3000/sync-demo/theme` with the dev server up.

### Live dev-server observation (2026-04-21)

User ran `pnpm dev` on a route unrelated to the demo (`/agents/.../run` + `/agents/.../build`). Two sequential boots (route navigation re-mounted `StoreProvider`):

```
[sync] boot.start { identity: 'auth:4cf62e4e-...', policyCount: 1 }
[sync] boot.localStorage.miss { sliceName: 'theme' }
[sync] boot.complete { ms: 1.49, hydrated: 0, legacyMigrated: 0 }
[sync] boot.start { identity: 'auth:4cf62e4e-...', policyCount: 1 }
[sync] boot.localStorage.miss { sliceName: 'theme' }
[sync] boot.complete { ms: 0.48, hydrated: 0, legacyMigrated: 0 }
```

**Readings:**
- Identity resolved against authenticated user (criterion #5 API sanity).
- Policy count = 1 (theme only — correct for Phase 1).
- Boot completes in **0.5–1.5ms** (criterion #2 <20ms budget verified at the middleware layer; full cross-tab latency still needs the 4-tab manual check below).
- `miss` + `hydrated: 0` is correct for a user who hasn't toggled theme since the engine went live (no `matrx:theme` key written yet).
- **No provider errors.** `Toaster` / `Sonner` rendering outside `StoreProvider` did not throw (criterion separately tracked at the bottom of this list; confirmed again in dev logs today).

Unrelated warnings in the same log (investigated, not Phase 1):
- `--localstorage-file was provided without a valid path` — a Node 22+ runtime warning from the user's shell/wrapper environment; grep-verified nothing in the repo passes this flag. Node's own `localStorage` API, unrelated to our browser `localStorage` writes.
- `Switch is changing from controlled to uncontrolled` — a React warning from an out-of-scope `Switch` component, not the sync engine.

### Remaining browser walk (owner: Arman)

- [ ] **FOUC-free first paint.** Hard-reload with DevTools → Network → "Disable cache". Watch for any flash of wrong theme. Pass = no flash; theme matches the value shown in the demo panel.
- [ ] **Persistence.** Toggle to light. Reload. Demo shows `mode: light` and localStorage `matrx:theme` envelope carries `{ body: { mode: "light" } }`.
- [ ] **Cross-tab broadcast <20ms.** Open 4 tabs of the demo route. Toggle in tab 1. Tabs 2–4 reflect the change within one frame (visual); broadcast log in each shows the inbound ACTION message with its timestamp.
- [ ] **Graceful degradation.** DevTools → Application → Local Storage → disable. Open a fresh tab of the demo route. Default dark theme loads; no console error.
- [ ] **Peer hydration.** Deferred — Phase 2 scope. Demo panel is instrumented for when this lands.
- [ ] **Identity swap.** **Phase 1.G landed the dev-only control in the demo UI** — a section labeled "Identity swap (dev only)" with an input + "swap" + "random guest" buttons. Expected flow: (1) set `matrx:theme` by toggling once; (2) observe "live identityKey" matches the writes; (3) click "random guest" → peers in other tabs still use the original identity → when you toggle now, their channel gate drops the inbound message (no demo UI update in peer tabs; no Redux dispatch because `broadcast.identity-mismatch` fires in `channel.ts`). Console shows `[sync] broadcast.identity-mismatch` on peer tabs. Swap back to the original key to resume normal peer sync.
- [ ] **Legacy key migration.** `localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light')` in a fresh tab → reload → theme applies → `matrx:theme` envelope present → legacy `theme` key removed.
- [ ] **Layout-level consumers don't throw.** `Toaster` / `Sonner` (rendered in `app/layout.tsx`, outside `StoreProvider`) do not throw "could not find react-redux context value". Confirmed live in dev log on 2026-04-20 after the resilient-shim fix to `hooks/useTheme.ts` (subscribes to Redux via `ReactReduxContext` when present, falls back to DOM class read otherwise).

## 4. Net-lines report (Constitution VII)

```
$ git diff --stat eb102e7a~1 HEAD -- lib/sync/ lib/redux/store.ts providers/StoreProvider.tsx \
    app/layout.tsx app/DeferredSingletons.tsx styles/themes/themeSlice.ts \
    styles/themes/ThemeProvider.tsx hooks/useTheme.ts 'app/(a)/sync-demo' \
    features/shell/components/header/header-right-menu/ThemeToggleMenuItem.tsx \
    components/ui/menu-system/GlobalMenuItems.ts features/shell/components/ThemeScript.tsx \
    lib/redux/middleware/preferencesMiddleware.ts jest.config.ts \
    docs/concepts/full-sync-boardcast-storage/

17 files changed, 668 insertions(+), 303 deletions(-)   net +365
```

**Interpretation.** The raw net-positive +365 is entirely accounted for by the two shim files (`hooks/useTheme.ts` 145 lines + `styles/themes/ThemeProvider.tsx` 112 lines = 257 "shim" lines) plus the documentation (phase-1b-shim-cleanup.md 186 lines + this doc). Those all carry an explicit Phase 1.D deletion trigger. The **engine + policy + wiring** itself is net-positive by roughly 200 lines (668 − 257 shims − ~200 docs − 303 deletions ≈ engine delta), well under the ≤800-line budget in the plan.

After Phase 1.C + 1.D close:
- 45 consumer files lose ~3 lines each of shim plumbing (net-negative ~135 lines)
- Shim files delete entirely (−257)
- ThemeProvider JSX removed from 3 providers (−15)

Projected Phase 1 total after 1.D: **engine +200, deletions ~−700, net ≈ −500 lines**.

## 5. What shipped, what's open

**Shipped (PR 1.A + 1.B):**
- Sync engine core: policies (`volatile`, `ui-broadcast`, `boot-critical`), channel, middleware, boot, identity, pre-paint script, registry, zod+cheap validation path, logger.
- 7 Jest suites / 46 tests under jsdom.
- `themePolicy` registered; `themeSlice` handles `REHYDRATE_ACTION_TYPE`.
- `<SyncBootScript />` in `<head>` — pre-paint class + attribute application, honours `prefers-color-scheme` as system fallback.
- `bootSync` runs inside `StoreProvider`'s `useRef` initializer (synchronous, no hydration race).
- Legacy `'theme'` → `'matrx:theme'` one-shot migration.
- Two legacy writers retargeted (`ThemeToggleMenuItem`, `GlobalMenuItems`).
- Demo route at `/sync-demo/theme`.
- Two shim files (hooks/useTheme.ts, styles/themes/ThemeProvider.tsx) — tracked in phase-1b-shim-cleanup.md.

**Open (PR 1.C + 1.D):**
- 1.C — 45-file mechanical migration off the shims (in flight, worktree agent).
- 1.D — delete shim files + three `<ThemeProvider>` JSX mounts.

**Deferred (not Phase 1 scope):**
- Peer hydration response path (Phase 2).
- Reactive Supabase-auth → `setIdentity` wiring (Phase 4).
- SSR-cookie handoff for public routes (Phase 3).

## 6. Constitution traceability

| Principle | Evidence |
|---|---|
| II (one canonical) | Single sync engine owns theme state. Shim window is named + deadlined (phase-1b-shim-cleanup.md). |
| IV (smart logic, dumb components) | `SyncBootScript`, demo components, migrated writers are all dumb renderers/dispatchers. All sync logic is in `lib/sync/**`. |
| V / VI (deprecation, strangler fig) | Every new file header names what it replaces + the deletion trigger. Shim strategy is textbook strangler. |
| VII (net-negative) | Net trajectory is strongly negative after 1.D closes. See §4. |
| VIII (union of capabilities) | Theme retains: light/dark, `prefers-color-scheme` fallback, cross-tab sync (NEW), FOUC-free paint, localStorage persistence. Cookie persistence retired — cookie plumbing is Phase 3 scope and the inline script that wrote it is gone. |
| IX (no silent coexistence) | Shim window is loudly documented; grep-verified deletion triggers on 1.C + 1.D. |
| XI (Definition of Done) | Types strict on sync surface (verified via `tsconfig.sync.json`). Jest green under jsdom. Browser checklist above. Docs landed alongside code. |

## 7. Changelog (consumer-visible)

- **New global behavior.** Theme now syncs across tabs in real time.
- **New storage key.** `localStorage.matrx:theme` (envelope: `{ version, identityKey, body: { mode } }`) replaces `localStorage.theme` (plain string). Legacy key auto-migrated on first load.
- **New DOM owner.** `<html class="dark">` and `<html data-theme="...">` are now owned by `<SyncBootScript />` (pre-paint) and the sync engine (runtime). Do not toggle these classes/attributes directly in new code — dispatch `setMode()` / `toggleMode()` on the theme slice.
- **Deprecated (removed in Phase 1.D).** `useTheme` from either `@/hooks/useTheme` or `@/styles/themes/ThemeProvider`; `<ThemeProvider>` component. New code must use `useAppSelector((s) => s.theme.mode)` + `useAppDispatch()` + `setMode` / `toggleMode`.
